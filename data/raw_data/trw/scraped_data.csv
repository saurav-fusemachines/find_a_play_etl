This was, of course, long before it was a park, when it was still wilderness. The family flourished for many generations, and eventually, a huge house was built where a great Spanish oak, the Addams Family Tree, had been planted to protect the ancestral graves from such annoyances as sunlight and tourists.', 'As the curtain rises, the last dead leaf of autumn falls from the Family Tree, and all is right with the morbid, macabre world of Gomez, Morticia, Fester, Grandma, Wednesday, Pugsley and Lurch. They’ve gathered – where else? – in the family graveyard, to celebrate life and death in a yearly ritual to connect with their past and ensure their future. They seem at peace, not just with each other and their inimitable, unchanging Addams-ness, but with their dead ancestors, too – who emerge from their graves on this night each year to join in this celebration of continuity. But, at the end of the ritual, Fester blocks the ancestors’ return to their graves. Those unchanging Addams family values are about to be tested.', 'Fester enlists their help to set things right, just in case a new family secret goes terribly wrong. What’s the secret? Wednesday Addams, that irresistible bundle of malice, has grown up and found love. So what’s the problem? The young man, Lucas Beineke, is from Ohio, and his parents are coming to dinner to meet the family. Two different worlds are about to collide. Will love triumph, or will everyone go home vaguely depressed? Gomez and Morticia are understandably wary. Wednesday is their baby, even if she is eighteen. Their doubts bloom into actual terror when they eavesdrop on Wednesday, who, in the midst of her afternoon play-date with Pugsley, refuses to torture her brother and involuntarily bursts into song – extolling all things bright and beautiful as love pulls her in an entirely new, and cheerful, direction.', 'Like any parents faced with a child in terrible trouble, Gomez and Morticia wonder, “Where did we go wrong?” Wednesday begs her parents not to cancel the dinner, and exhorts the entire family to act as ‘normal’ as possible when Lucas and his parents arrive. She loves her family just the way they are, but they clearly fall outside the realm of what the Middle-American Beinekes are used to, and Wednesday’s afraid that, if his parents don’t approve of her, they’ll take Lucas back to Ohio, and she’ll never see him again. Like any unconditionally loving family, the Addams’ promise to do their best to oblige, while, lost somewhere in Central Park, young Lucas asks his parents to resist any judgments and all catastrophic conflicts, so both families can enjoy one normal night.', 'In yet another part of the house, Pugsley, having witnessed Wednesday and Lucas making out, worries that he’s lost his best friend to her new, disgustingly sunny disposition. Plotting to break up the happy couple, Pugsley steals a volatile potion from Grandma’s private stash – Acrimonium – one swig of which is guaranteed to bring out the dark side in anyone who drinks it. After what is likely a less-than-normal meal, Wednesday hushes\xa0the table for Lucas’ surprise announcement. But Gomez reminds Wednesday that, before anything else happens, it’s time for the traditional Addams family game, “Full Disclosure” – during which everyone takes a sip from a sacred chalice and reveals something they’ve never told anyone. Gomez uses his Disclosure to try, again in vain, to calm Morticia. Fester announces that he’s in the throes of a most unlikely love – with the moon. When it’s Wednesday’s turn, Pugsley seizes his chance! He secretly pours the Acrimonium potion in the chalice and passes it to his sister. But his plan to awaken the dark side in Wednesday goes horribly wrong when Alice, coughing, intercepts the chalice and downs the potion instead. A whole new Alice, very dark and uninhibited, is born. The powerful poison prompts her to reveal the long-buried problems with her marriage, humiliating Mal, who, fed up with all the weird and creepy events of the evening, makes to leave, with Alice and Lucas in tow. Wednesday blurts out the news: “Lucas and I are getting married!” Chaos engulfs both families like a tidal wave, and Fester, ever-helpful, urges the Family Ancestors to work some magic – whipping up a sudden, terrible storm and trapping the Beinekes with the Addams family for the night.', 'While the storm rages, Wednesday packs a bag, but Lucas has no appetite for running away and getting married without his parents’ blessing. Wednesday, furious at everything it means to be normal, and furious at herself for trying so hard to become somebody his parents would accept,leaves alone. One more of Gomez’ episodes prompts Morticia to throw him out of her boudoir. Her world is changing and she’s not ready, and her only comfort is knowing that death is waiting for her, just around the corner. But it is very cold comfort indeed. In the guest room, Alice, under the influence of the darkness potion, can no longer rhyme. Neither can she tolerate her husband’s cynical attacks on Lucas and love. She packs him off with a pillow and blanket to sleep somewhere else, as the storm inside her heart, and outside in the park, rumbles to a conclusion.', 'Once the rains have stopped, Fester heads outside for a couple of hours of moon-bathing, realizing – after observing the three couples fighting – the sheer luck of being in a long-distance relationship, with the distant silver orb in the sky that smiles down on him from the heavens. Sitting under the family tree, contemplating the twists and turns of this most unusual night, Gomez stops Wednesday on her way out of the park. He realizes the thing he was most resistant to – his baby girl’s growing up – is inevitable, and proper. He sees that she’s a young woman in love. And that makes him happy. And a tiny bit sad. With her father’s blessing, Wednesday offers Lucas one test to prove that he’s The One. The test involves her skills with a crossbow, an apple, and Lucas standing with said apple on his head in front of the family tree. The boy is afraid of death, \xa0but even more afraid of losing Wednesday. He chooses the possibility of death over the certainty of loss – and wins. Far below, in the grotto, Gomez and Mal, two displaced husbands, realize they have more in common than they would have dared imagine only a few hours earlier. While Mal is with Gomez, Lurch ushers Alice down to the grotto. She’s a woman on a mission;\xa0she’s going to lay down the law; changes must be made if the marriage is to\xa0survive.', 'Morticia packs a bag and is ready to leave. But the ancestors’ spirits have led Gomez to find her. The other warring couples, Wednesday and Lucas, Alice and Mal, have\xa0made their peace. Now Gomez woos his wife, as he first did one night many years\xa0before, with the promise to “laugh and cry and dance until the very gods weep\xa0with envy.” The mournful strains of a bandoneon waft up on the breeze, entwining\xa0with the tempting wail of a violin – and a tango begins – the Tango de Amor, the\xa0quintessence of Eros, the dance that makes men weep and women cry out in the\xa0night. The irresistible expression of love between husband and wife. And Morticia\xa0cannot resist. With all three couples reunited, Fester is emboldened to make his move, and\xa0launches himself to the moon. Landing safely, his face appears – the man in the\xa0moon – and, love having emphatically triumphed in heaven and on earth, the gate\xa0to the family crypt swings open, allowing the spirits of the ancestors to rest for\xa0another year. It’s been a night of darkness. Everything’s changed. And the new, extended family\xa0understands: The unknown may be frightening, the darkness overwhelming,but if we don’t run from it, we may see our mysterious, miraculous lives finally\xa0illuminated. If we move toward the darkness, we might find love and acceptance. For when it is dark enough, we can see the stars.', '– Rick Elice (Book)']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

(“Jailhouse Rock”). The warden doesn’t appreciate a guy like Chad ridin’ into town, playin’ his music and excitin’ the local women. With a sneer, Chad rides off. In a nearby dreary little town, Natalie, a young mechanic, is dreaming of love and adventure. She yearns for one true love to take her away, but she doesn’t realize that her best friend Dennis has a secret crush on her. Sitting in Sylvia’s, the local honky tonk, the whole town sings the blues (“Heartbreak Hotel”). Natalie’s widowed father Jim enters and joins in, until they’re interrupted by the roar of a motorcycle: it is Chad, riding into town (“Roustabout”). Chad is in need of a mechanic and he’s introduced to Natalie, who is instantly smitten (“One Night With You”) and promises to fix his bike. Chad asks about any excitement in town, but he’s told that excitement is outlawed under the Mayor’s strict rules: no loud music, no indecent behavior. Chad, incensed, promises to breathe some life into this sad, little town and he touches a broken-down jukebox, and it immediately comes to life (“C’mon Everybody”). As Chad and Natalie go off to fix his bike, Mayor Matilda enters with Earl, the sheriff, and her son, Dean. Matilda scolds the citizens for dancing and singing, and then goes off to find the root of this newfound evil. As soon as she exits, Dean meets Lorraine, Sylvia’s pretty African-American daughter, and the two share a nervous and flirtatious smile. Meanwhile, Natalie is working on Chad’s motorcycle. She tells him of her dreams of the open road, and he tells her that she must follow her heart (“Follow That Dream”). After Chad exits, Natalie, in an attempt to look more girly, puts on the only dress she owns—a tattered old one she uses to clean car engines. Dennis runs into Natalie and he is about to tell her how he feels for her, when Chad enters and interrupts. Ignoring Natalie, Chad asks Dennis to become his sidekick and the overjoyed Dennis accepts. Suddenly, the beautiful and glamorous Sandra appears, and Chad is struck down with a case of hardcore love (“One Night With You”—reprise). Sandra is the owner of the local museum, and she bemoans the lack of culture in this depressing little town. Chad tries to smooth-talk her, but she resists (“Teddy Bear/Hound Dog”). Later that day, at Sylvia’s Honky Tonk, Jim and Sylvia speak about the strange, lascivious behavior that seems to have befallen the town since Chad’s arrival. Natalie enters in her greasy dress, and Lorraine has her change into one of her dresses—it is clean and cute and Natalie looks lovely. She rushes off in pursuit of Chad. Both Sylvia and Jim agree that at a certain point in life, it’s better to be alone, when Sandra enters and Jim instantly falls for her (“One Night With You”—reprise). Too nervous to speak to such a vision of beauty, he rushes out. Dean enters to tell Lorraine that he thinks she’s beautiful. Lorraine, thrilled, begins to teach him to dance (“That’s All Right”). Sylvia interrupts and insists that it’s NOT all right for them to be together, and Dean rushes out. Dean meets Matilda at the bus stop, and she tells him that she’s sending him back to military school on the next bus. Lorraine enters, and Dean tells her the terrible news—they’re about to be separated. Hopelessly in love, Dean and Lorraine decide to run off together (“It’s Now Or Never”). Both Jim and Chad follow Sandra, but she will have nothing to do with either of them. Dennis meets Natalie on the street and shows off his new hunting cap, which makes him feel like “one of the guys.” Natalie has a sudden inspiration and she grabs Dennis’ hunting cap. Alone in the garage, she dresses like a leather-jacketed male roustabout (“Love Me Tender”). As Chad bemoans Sandra’s lack of attraction to him, Dennis comes up with an idea. He volunteers to take her a Shakespearean sonnet. Desperate, Chad agrees. But before Dennis leaves, a leather-jacked roustabout rides into town (“Blue Suede Shoes”). It is Natalie, dressed as a fellah named Ed. Chad is excited by Ed’s coolness and manliness and he asks Ed to be his new sidekick. Heartbroken, Dennis exits. Chad instructs Ed that his first job as his new sidekick is to give the sonnet to Miss Sandra. Jim enters, and Ed grabs the sonnet and rushes off. Jim tells Chad that he’s in love with a woman who doesn’t love him back. Chad looks over the slovenly Jim, and tells him that in order to win a girl, Jim must dress and act more like Chad. Chad gives Jim a much-needed lesson in coolness (“Don’t Be Cruel”). Ed arrives at the museum and gives Sandra the sonnet. Sandra is so moved by the sonnet that she finds herself drawn to this strange-looking young man (“One Night With You”—reprise). Ed tries to leave, but Sandra is intent on seducing him (“Let Yourself Go”). As the sun goes down, Mayor Matilda is cracking down on the perceived immoral behavior that is now running rampant through the town. She comes upon a necking couple, and she’s stunned to see that it’s her precious Dean kissing Lorraine. Dean, for the first time, disobeys his mother and shows her that he can now dance. He and Lorraine run off into the night. Matilda promises to throw Chad in jail for what he has done, and she and Sheriff Earl drive after Dean. Ed tells Chad that in order to avoid jail, he should hide in the abandoned fairgrounds just outside of town. Chad runs off, and Ed runs off after him. Jim, now dressed like Chad, enters and asks Sylvia if she’s seen Sandra. Sylvia tells Jim that he’s crazy to fall for a woman like that, and Jim admonishes Sylvia for having grown cold and bitter. Jim gives Sylvia a very surprising kiss, and a stunned Sylvia suddenly falls for him. Soon, everyone in town find themselves escaping to the fairgrounds, searching for someone to love (“Can’t Help Falling In Love”).', 'ACT TWO ', 'In the midst of the abandoned fairgrounds, the citizens of the town are restless and randy (“All Shook Up”). Dennis comes upon Natalie, who’s still dressed as Ed, and Dennis reveals that he’s upset about the way Chad treats her (“It Hurts Me”). Natalie insists that Chad is the only guy for her. In an attempt to win Chad, Natalie gets an idea—she convinces Chad to teach her (i.e. Ed) how to seduce a woman (“A Little Less Conversation”) but in the process, Ed winds up kissing Chad. Chad is stunned and Ed runs off as Jim enters. Chad reaffirms his machismo (“Power Of My Love”) when Jim and Chad suddenly realize they are both in love with the same woman. Sandra enters, lustfully looking for Ed. Jim confesses his love for Sandra, but she doesn’t even remember meeting him. As the heartbroken Jim slinks off, Ed enters, and he insists that Sandra leave them alone. Sandra, still hot for Ed, relents and promises to find him later. Left alone, Chad is about to hit Ed, but he realizes that he can’t. Ed gives Chad some “alone time”, and Chad realizes that he has feelings for his new sidekick (“I Don’t Want To”). In another part of the fairgrounds, Mayor Matilda enters, followed, as always, by the silent Sheriff Earl, and she vows to bring the roustabout down (“Devil In Disguise”). A heartbroken Jim wanders about and runs into Sylvia, who is wearing her best Sunday dress. He wonders what she’s doing out there this time of night, and she confesses her newfound feelings for him (“There’s Always Me”). Jim can’t handle this revelation, and he rushes off. In another part of the grounds, Dean and Lorraine plan to catch the morning train out of town, but Chad convinces them to stay and fight for their love (“If I Can Dream”). In the center of the fairgrounds, Matilda gathers the townspeople together to form a pious posse to both find her son and arrest Chad. But Chad enters, as does Dean and Lorraine—and the final confrontation begins… Will true love prevail? (“Fools Fall In Love”) Will the power of music win the day? Will this small town in the Midwest survive getting all shook up? These questions and more are answered as the characters come together for the finale (“Burning Love”).']","{'sets': ['TheatreWorld Backdrops'], 'costumes': ['KJK Productions', 'The Music and Theatre Company', 'DC Theatricks\xa0Dave Dejac, info@costume.com 747 Main Street Buffalo, NY 14203 Phone: (716)847-0180', 'Costume Holiday House, 3038 Hayes Avenue, Fremont OH 43420, 419-334-3236', 'For specific questions\xa0please feel free to contact us at: theatre@costumeholidayhouse.com.'], 'props': ['Prop Rentals NY', 'Featuring Must Haves & Additional Choices', 'Phone: (516) 459-0106', 'John@proprentalsny.com']}"

His son WILL (20s) is getting married the next day. Will asks Edward not to tell any of his crazy stories at the wedding. Edward reluctantly agrees. As Will thinks back, he trades places with YOUNG WILL (8). Edward doesn’t want to read his son a bedtime story from a book, but rather tell a story about life (“Be the Hero”), which introduces many characters from Edward’s impossible stories. Edward’s wife SANDRA reminds them that it’s time for bed, but Young Will wants to know more about THE WITCH who showed Edward how he would die (“The Witch”).\u2028\u2028 The story returns to present day. Preparing for the wedding, Edward reveals his suspicion that Will’s fiancée, JOSEPHINE, is pregnant. Will confirms the hunch and swears Edward to secrecy. But Edward can’t help himself, revealing the news in a toast to the crowd. In parallel scenes at doctors’ offices, Will and Josephine learn they’re going to have a son, while Edward and Sandra learn that Edward’s cancer has progressed. In New York’s Central Park, Will sings of the wonder and mystery of his future child (“Stranger”), but his joy is interrupted by a phone call from his mother, telling him about Edward’s condition. Will says he’s coming home. \u2028\u2028In the backyard, Sandra tells Will that although he and Edward can be a handful, she loves them both (“Two Men”). Josephine is eager to hear more of Edward’s stories, so he launches into a tale of his high school days (“Ashton’s Favorite Son”), including his small-town girlfriend (JENNY HILL) and his arch-rival (DON PRICE). Edward journeys to a cave to confront a giant that is frightening the town. But rather than fight KARL THE GIANT, he befriends him and convinces him to join him on an adventure to see the world.\xa0 (“Out There on the Road”). \u2028\u2028Back in the present, Josephine gets Will to tell her the story of how his parents met, which brings them to the Calloway Circus. Sandra and two friends audition for ringmaster AMOS CALLOWAY (“Little Lamb from Alabama”), during which Edward falls in love with her at first sight (“Time Stops”). Amos hires Karl The Giant, while Edward agrees to work for the circus for free in exchange for one monthly clue about Sandra (“Closer to Her”). After three years of toil, Amos (secretly a werewolf) finally reveals that her name is Sandra, she goes to Auburn University, and she loves daffodils. In the present, Josephine discovers a mortgage signed by Edward and Jenny Hill.\xa0 Will wonders why his father would buy a house with a woman other than his mother. \u2028\u2028Edward travels to Auburn, only to discover that Sandra is engaged to be married to Don Price from Ashton. Don beats up Edward, but that convinces Sandra to break up with Don. Edward promises to love Sandra forever (“Daffodils”). They kiss.', 'ACT II', 'Reeling from the discovery of the mortgage, Will wonders if his dad had a second life. A second family. At a campfire, Edward tells Young Will and other scouts about his adventures during The War (“Red, White, and True”), in which he defeats the poison assassin Red Fang. Young Will confronts his father on the impossible historical details. Later, Edward tells Sandra and Young Will he’ll be traveling more for work. Edward tells Young Will he’ll be the man of the house. He needs to be brave and “Fight the Dragons.” \u2028\u2028In the present, Will attempts to ask his father about the mortgage, but Edward keeps derailing the conversation with jokes and talk of wooly mammoths. When Will brings up Ashton, Edward grows angry and throws him out. Calmed down by Sandra, Edward falls into an uneasy sleep and dreams of a Western-style duel over the issue (“Showdown”). He wakes up yelling and confused in the middle of a thunderstorm. Sandra comforts him, telling him “I Don’t Need a Roof” to feel at home. She only needs Edward. \u2028\u2028Will travels to Ashton, where he meets Jenny Hill. She tells him the story of what happened when Edward returned to Ashton. The valley is about to be flooded by a new reservoir, yet the townsfolk refuse to leave, chaining themselves to a statue in protest. Edward convinces them to build a new Ashton (“Start Over”). He gets land from Amos and money from Karl, both of whom have become successful because of Edward. Only Jenny Hill refuses to leave. She’d been waiting in Ashton all these years for Edward to return. To save her life, Edward reconnects with her, and co-signs the mortgage on a new house. They kiss — but Edward breaks it off. From the moment he saw her until the moment he dies, Sandra is the only woman he’ll love. As Jenny Hill finishes the story, Will gets a phone call. Edward’s condition has worsened.\u2028\u2028 Alone in the hospital with the unconscious Edward, Will tells him that he went to Ashton, and that he now understands the reason for his stories. Edward stirs, in pain, and asks Will to tell him how he dies. Will has to make up the story on the spot (“What’s Next”) of how Edward escapes the hospital and travels to the river, where everyone from his stories is waiting for him. At the river, Edward sings about his life and what it meant (“How it Ends”). Back in reality, Edward dies in the hospital bed.\u2028\u2028 The funeral takes place at the river’s edge. As the guests shake Will’s hand, he sees that each is the real-world equivalent of the characters from Edward’s stories. A few years later, Will teaches his own son to fish, and the secret his father taught him (“Be the Hero” reprise).']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

His son WILL (20s) is getting married the next day. Will asks Edward not to tell any of his crazy stories at the wedding. Edward reluctantly agrees. As Will thinks back, he trades places with YOUNG WILL (8). Edward doesn’t want to read his son a bedtime story from a book, but rather tell a story about life (“Be the Hero”), which introduces many characters from Edward’s impossible stories. Edward’s wife SANDRA reminds them that it’s time for bed, but Young Will wants to know more about THE WITCH who showed Edward how he would die (“The Witch”).\u2028\u2028 The story returns to present day. Preparing for the wedding, Edward reveals his suspicion that Will’s fiancée, JOSEPHINE, is pregnant. Will confirms the hunch and swears Edward to secrecy. But Edward can’t help himself, revealing the news in a toast to the crowd. In parallel scenes at doctors’ offices, Will and Josephine learn they’re going to have a son, while Edward and Sandra learn that Edward’s cancer has progressed. In New York’s Central Park, Will sings of the wonder and mystery of his future child (“Stranger”), but his joy is interrupted by a phone call from his mother, telling him about Edward’s condition. Will says he’s coming home. \u2028\u2028In the backyard, Sandra tells Will that although he and Edward can be a handful, she loves them both (“Magic in the Man”). Josephine is eager to hear more of Edward’s stories, so he launches into a tale of his high school days (“Ashton’s Favorite Son”), including his small-town girlfriend (JENNY HILL) and his arch-rival (DON PRICE). Edward journeys to a cave to confront a giant that is frightening the town. But rather than fight KARL THE GIANT, he befriends him and convinces him to join him on an adventure to see the world.\xa0 (“Out There on the Road”). \u2028\u2028Back in the present, Josephine gets Will to tell her the story of how his parents met, which brings them to the Calloway Circus. Sandra and two friends audition for ringmaster AMOS CALLOWAY (“Little Lamb from Alabama”), during which Edward falls in love with her at first sight (“Time Stops”). Amos hires Karl The Giant, while Edward agrees to work for the circus for free in exchange for one monthly clue about Sandra (“Closer to Her”). After three years of toil, Amos (secretly a werewolf) finally reveals that her name is Sandra, she goes to Auburn University, and she loves daffodils. In the present, Josephine discovers a mortgage signed by Edward and Jenny Hill.\xa0 Will wonders why his father would buy a house with a woman other than his mother. \u2028\u2028Edward travels to Auburn, only to discover that Sandra is engaged to be married to Don Price from Ashton. Don beats up Edward, but that convinces Sandra to break up with Don. Edward promises to love Sandra forever (“Daffodils”). They kiss. Act 2 Reeling from the discovery of the mortgage, Will wonders if his dad had a second life. A second family. Later, Edward tells Sandra and Young Will he’ll be traveling more for work. Edward tells Young Will he’ll be the man of the house. He needs to be brave and “Fight the Dragons.” \u2028\u2028In the present, Will attempts to ask his father about the mortgage, but Edward keeps derailing the conversation with jokes and talk of wooly mammoths.

Terrific comedic actress with a belt.', 'AARON FOX (30’s – 40’s, similar age to GEORGIA) The composer of the show-within-the-show. His songwriting partner, Georgia, is also his wife, from whom he’s separated but for whom he still pines.\xa0 He’s a handsome, intense, somewhat tortured artist-type. Requires a strong vocalist with comedy.', 'SIDNEY BERNSTEIN (Late 50’s-Mid 60’s): The always-angry, sleazy, philandering producer of the out-of-town flop. Sidney is rough around the edges and completely self-serving. Requires a cartoon-like character actor who is funny on arrival. No singing required.', 'CHRISTOPHER BELLING (40-60) English director. Very camp. Very droll. Noel Coward meets Addison DeWitt meets Clifton Webb. Requires a superb comic actor.', 'BAMBI BERNÉT (Early 20’s-early 30’s) Performer in the chorus, daughter of Carmen, step-daughter of Sidney. Genuinely brassy and artificially blonde. Hungry to work her way out of the chorus; many think she was only hired because of her mother. She surprises everyone, however, when she shows genuine dancing and singing talent when at last called upon. Requires great dancing, strong “street-smart dumb blonde” comedy, and singing.', 'OSCAR SHAPIRO (45-65): from the garment district and sole investor in “Robbin’ Hood.” A likeably gruff man who knows nothing about theatre and frets over every dime of his that’s spent. Requires good “rough around the edges” comedy and singing.', 'BOBBY PEPPER (30’s to early 40’s, similar age as Georgia and Aaron) The Gene Kelly of “Robbin’ Hood,” its choreographer and male star, and a handsome rival to Aaron for Georgia’s affection. Requires strong dancing, singing, comedy.', 'DARYL GRADY (30’s-40’s): Caustic and smug theatre critic for the local Boston newspaper. Patronizingly pompous, enjoys using his power to make or break shows during their Boston tryouts. Does not require strong singing or dancing.', 'JOHNNY HARMON * (30’s-60’s) Stage Manager of the show-within-the-show, and both drill sergeant and mother hen to the cast. Barks orders but has a pleasant side as well, he keeps the company in line and on their toes throughout the rehearsal process. Comic actor who can sing.', 'JESSICA CRANSHAW (40’s-60’s) Faded Hollywood star, a grand diva with no right to be one, and a plague to the show-with-the-show and to her cast. An absolutely dreadful singer and inept actress who stars in the show-within-a-show and gets murdered on its opening night in Boston. Must be skillful enough to sing hilariously out-of-tune and ineptly, and adroit enough to dance perfectly out of step with the rest of the cast. Appears only in the first minutes of the musical; on Broadway, this performer then adopted a different look and became part of the ensemble.', 'RANDY DEXTER (20’s – 30’s) a member of the singing & dancing ensemble featured in “Kansasland,” pleasant but with a sensitive side.', 'HARV FREMONT (20’s – 30’s) a member of the singing & dancing ensemble who bears a bouquet. ROBERTA WOOSTER (20’s – 30’s) a member of the singing & dancing ensemble who speaks from experience.', 'ENSEMBLE *Note:\xa0 the role of JOHNNY HARMON can be played by a woman using the name JENNY HARMON, with all the same character traits as described. It is not recommended that any other roles described above be played by the opposite gender, as it would be contrary to the dynamics of the mystery, the comedy, and the period.']",https://www.theatricalrights.com/apply-for-a-license/?select-show=curtains,"

Boston’s Colonial Theatre is host to the opening night performance of Robbin’ Hood!, “a new musical of the Old West”. The curtains rise on the show’s merciful finale. Act Two. Scene 23. As the valiant cast proclaims their undying affection for the Wide Open Spaces of Kansas, a sour note is sounded by the voice of faded film star Jessica Cranshaw, who can’t act, can’t sing, and can’t dance — not even a little. Jessica’s name may be above the title, but her performance has been beneath contempt, both on-stage and off. She takes her mandatory bow in front of the cowboy-costumed company, gathers up her obligatory bouquets from a pair of tuxedoed ushers, and collapses in a heap, easily the most graceful move she’s made all evening. The cast rushes to their fallen star behind the fallen curtain and bear the unbearable Jessica off to Boston Hospital. A few hours later, on the now darkened Colonial stage, four tormented souls in evening dress search the night owl editions of the Boston morning papers for a single charitable review. The show’s composer, Aaron Fox and lyricist Georgia Hendricks — recently divorced but professionally reunited in an attempt to create musical magic where their marriage has otherwise gone flat — find nary a quote to pull. Equally empty-handed is the show’s lone financial backer Oscar Shapiro, fashion maven but theatre novitiate. Slightly less daunted is Carmen Bernstein, co-producer (with her husband Sidney) of Robbin’ Hood! The four speculate about “What Kind of Man”, woman, or beast would ever choose to be a critic. They are joined by feverishly fey director, Christopher Belling, who announces he’s just given birth to a brainchild the producers must instantly adopt. To demonstrate his plan, he asks Georgia to sing Jessica Cranshaw’s first ballad in the show. It’s no secret to the company that Georgia has recently rekindled a past romance with leading man Bobby Pepper. Though her ex-husband may be accompanying her at the piano, Georgia is clearly thinking of Bobby as she sings “Thinking of Him”. Director Belling reveals his masterful plan: as long as Jessica Cranshaw is indisposed, her part should be filled by Georgia, a former stage performer who obviously knows the show inside and out because she is its co-creator. All approve, except ex-husband Aaron, who points out that the issue is academic if Jessica Cranshaw returns to work. But the fateful news arrives: “The Woman’s Dead”. An impromptu funeral ceremony in Jessica’s honor is interrupted by the arrival of Homicide Lieutenant Frank Cioffi, who saw Robbin’ Hood! in previews and thinks that, with the exception of the late Miss Cranshaw, the cast are all spectacular performers in one heck of a show. The Lieutenant has done some amateur theatrical work himself, and he is as shocked as Carmen Bernstein to learn that the cast does not feel the show must go on. He and Carmen must remind the company that they are part of a special breed known as “Show People”. With their faith in themselves and Robbin’ Hood! renewed, the cast prepares to leave for the night when Cioffi explains that they can’t. Since an autopsy has revealed that Jessica Cranshaw swallowed poison pellets in the last minutes of the show, during which time she never left the stage, it’s clear she was murdered by a member of the company. Cioffi feels the surest way to solve the crime will be to keep the entire cast of suspicious characters sequestered in the theatre. Sidney Bernstein, the show’s senior producing partner (and Carmen’s philandering lesser half) arrives from New York — or at least that’s where he claims to have been at the time of the murder. Cioffi is left alone with local neophyte actress Niki Harris, who understudied Jessica Cranshaw but is now covering for Georgia. The police detective is clearly smitten with Niki’s winsome charm and confides in her about his investigation. They learn that they are both married … to their respective careers, which in Cioffi’s case has resulted in a life of lunch counter mornings and “Coffee Shop Nights”. The next day, as Georgia struggles to regain her show biz sea legs, Carmen and Sidney Bernstein invite Boston Globe senior drama critic Daryl Grady to pay them a visit, much to his bewilderment, since his review of the show found precious little to praise. The producers ask Grady to re-review their musical with its new lead, but the best he can offer is to appraise the next evening’s re-opening. With Grady’s challenge accepted, Chris Belling prepares to restage a particularly troublesome number, entitled “In the Same Boat”. Cioffi is startled to hear himself suggest that the problem might lie in the song itself, and the director is surprised to hear himself agree. Composer Aaron Fox is urged to concoct a different number for the same slot in the show, minus the assistance of his ex-wife who, owing to her frantic rehearsal schedule, has now become his ex-writing partner as well. In private with Lieutenant Cioffi, the composer makes a most unexpected confession. (“I Miss the Music”) Any doubt that Georgia could hold the stage is happily dispelled by the dress rehearsal of the big saloon hall number “Thataway!” But as the Act One curtain descends, murder rises to the occasion, and a key member of the company is forced to face The Big Blackout.', 'Act II', 'The second act begins with the updated medical status of the most recent victim: “The Man is Dead”. Curtains rise upon a makeshift dormitory on the Colonial’s stage, as things go bump in the night and the company, in varying stages of dress and undress, point fingers of suspicion at each other, puzzling over whether She or “He Did It”. Cioffi arrives with a grim report from the coroner and even graver concerns about the show’s rapidly-approaching deadline. Aaron previews his best effort at “In the Same Boat #2” but the zealous Cioffi sends it back to the drawing board once again, while urging that star Bobby Pepper be added to the Fort Henderson square dance. This prompts Bambi, an aspiring chorine and also Carmen’s daughter, to plead for a pas de deux (“for two”) for herself and Bobby, as a spotlight moment in the number. Carmen reluctantly gives Bambi her chance, although she reminds her that a hard-nosed producer watches the box office, not the stage, and in commercial theatre, the bottom line is: “It’s a Business”. Much to Carmen’s surprise, Bambi shines in the rehearsal of the restaged Kansasland. But even as Bambi gets her big shot, Bobby Pepper gets his, from a gun offstage. Or was someone else the target? Cioffi’s craft as a detective takes center stage as he traces the bullet’s torturous path. He is also able to solve the mystery of why Aaron Fox and Georgia Hendricks were so anxious to work on Robbin’ Hood! as the former husband and wife team discover ample reason to renew their vows. (“Thinking of Him/I Miss the Music Reprise”). With the spotlight suddenly on romance, Cioffi’s magnifying glass focuses on the ingénue who’s too-good-to-be-true. In his wildest dreams, instead of tracking footprints, he’d be trading steps with Niki up a theatrical stairway, making moves that even Fred and Ginger would find “A Tough Act to Follow”. But in the realm of homicide, the blink of an eye can turn daydream into nightmare, as Cioffi realizes that Niki is carrying a secret, one she has shared with stage manager Johnny Harmon. Johnny’s lips remain sealed — and the killer hopes to keep them that way forever. Cioffi’s investigation takes him high above the stage and, hearing the chorus below as they rehearse “In the Same Boat #3”, he hits upon a solution to some (if not all) the production’s problems, in a melodic amalgam that finally sees “In the Same Boat Completed”. With that immense puzzle solved to the company’s satisfaction, Cioffi has merely to piece together the clues he’s gathered, correctly unmask the killer, save the life of the murderer’s next intended victim, render the fiend harmless, make sense of a troubling but telltale observation, and find a new finale for the show. In doing so, Carmen Bernstein gives Cioffi the highest praise he could ever hope to receive: he is truly one of those “Show People” who understands why the show must go on. The revamped “Wide Open Spaces Finale” may be “A Tough Act to Follow (reprise)”, but for Lieutenant Frank Cioffi, the curtain is just about to rise on the greatest joy of his life.']","{'sets': ['Music Theatre of Wichita', 'Ja’Duke Theatre Inc.', ''], 'costumes': ['Syracuse Talent Company Christine Lightcap 315-637-3733 chrislightcap@aol.com', 'Broadway Costumes 1100 West Cermak Road · Second Floor Chicago · Illinois · 60608 · USA 800-397-3316', 'Costume Holiday House, 3038 Hayes Avenue, Fremont OH 43420, 419-334-3236', 'For specific questions\xa0please feel free to contact us at:\xa0theatre@costumeholidayhouse.com.', ''], 'props': ['Prop Rentals NY', 'Featuring Must Haves & Additional Choices', 'Phone: (516) 459-0106', 'John@proprentalsny.com', '']}"

On the mill floor, she catches the eye of Nick Hurley, the son of the mill owner, who decides he wants to learn more about her.', 'En route to the club, Alex meets up with her friend Gloria, who encourages Alex to pursue her dream of becoming a trained dancer in a legitimate company by applying to audition for the renowned Shipley Academy. \xa0Alex decides to take the chance and asks the academy’s administrator, Ms. Wilde, for an application (“It’s All in Reach”).', 'As Alex warms up to perform at Harry’s, her good friends (and fellow dancers) Kiki, Tess and Gloria sing “Maniac.” \xa0Alex steps onto the club stage, and she’s captivating. \xa0After her performance, she’s approached by Nick Hurley, but she rebuffs him, concerned about getting involved with her own boss. \xa0In the dressing room, her girlfriends can’t believe she’d turn down someone as attractive as Nick, but Alex sticks to her guns. \xa0Gloria, who waits tables at Harry’s but longs to perform, gets an education from the women in what inspires a “flashdance” (“Put It On”). \xa0But when the bar’s owner, Harry, enters and complains that a new lap-dance joint called Chameleon — opened down the street by a shady entrepreneur named C.C. — is starting to siphon off his once-loyal customers, Alex realizes her days at Harry’s may be numbered (“It’s All in Reach” reprise).', 'Anxious about her audition, Alex visits her elderly friend Hannah, a retired dancer who bolsters Alex’s confidence about getting into Shipley (“A Million to One”). Alex reports to Shipley for a preliminary audition, but she’s quickly intimidated by the accomplished, trained dancers all around her (“Inside”). \xa0She rushes out, crestfallen.', 'The next day, Nick approaches Alex in the steel mill’s lunchroom, but once again she rejects his advances. \xa0Nick gets a playful jabbing from the steel men, who are happy to see him knocked off his pedestal (“Justice”). After they exit, he’s approached by his secretary, who shows him a list of workers slated to be fired as the company starts to outsource its manufacturing. \xa0Nick’s affection (and respect) for Alex put him in a tough spot (“Justice” reprise).', 'At Harry’s Bar, Gloria is hit on by C.C., the owner of the Chameleon Club. Nick, who is \xa0waiting at the club for another chance to talk to Alex, fends C.C. off. \xa0Alex is impressed by Nick’s chivalry and finally agrees to let him take her on a date. \xa0Gloria confronts her longtime boyfriend Jimmy, who is a fellow waiter at Harry’s (and Harry’s nephew), and demands to know why Jimmy never sticks up for her. \xa0Jimmy admits that he has plans to go to New York to make it as a stand-up comic; furthermore, he intends to go alone. \xa0Gloria is deeply hurt, and they break up (“Gloria”). \xa0Tess takes the stage at Harry’s to perform a rousing interpretation of “I Love Rock n’ Roll.”', 'Nick and Alex return to her place from their date and start to move past their assumptions about one another; she admits to her dream of attending Shipley, while he confesses that he’s torn about the employees his family wants him to fire. They begin to fall in love (“Here and Now”).', 'A few weeks later, Alex goes to Hannah holding an envelope from the Shipley Academy, and opens it to discover she’s been called back for a final audition (“My Next Step”). \xa0Meanwhile, C.C. lures Gloria into working at the Chameleon, while Nick visits Ms. Wilde to thank her for letting Alex have a callback — which he has paid for with a “contribution” to the Academy. \xa0Blissfully unaware of all this, Alex steps onto Harry’s stage and dances exuberantly, finishing with an iconic blast of water from above.', 'Act 2', 'At the Chameleon Club, the girls perform lasciviously as Gloria — increasingly dependent on alcohol and cocaine — realizes she’s gotten in too deep with C.C. (“Chameleon Girl”).', 'Alex and Nick, now very much in love, head off to face the day’s challenges (“Here and Now” reprise). \xa0Alex goes to Hannah for further audition advice, and Hannah counsels Alex to forego attempting to dance classically for the judges in favor of something that expresses Alex’s unique talent and style; Nick, meanwhile, prepares to plead his case against firing the steel workers (“My Turn”).', 'Jimmy returns from New York, his dreams of becoming a famous stand-up comic quickly dashed. \xa0He asks his Uncle Harry for his job back, and Harry, after some initial reluctance, agrees, glad to have Jimmy home (“Where I Belong”).', 'Nick fails to convince his family they should hold onto the workers. \xa0When Alex discovers that many of her friends at the plant are getting laid off, she and Nick argue, causing him to inadvertently admit he arranged her callback at Shipley. Alex walks out on him in a fury, leaving Nick to question his place in the company and his path in life.', 'Kiki performs a flashdance to “Manhunt,” as Harry continues to worry about C.C.’s growing success. \xa0Alex, still upset from her fight with Nick and coping with learning the truth about her Shipley callback, discovers that Gloria — who she thought was away caring for a relative — has in fact been with C.C. at the Chameleon. \xa0She rashly decides to go to Chameleon, rescuing Gloria (with some last-minute chivalry from none other than Jimmy). \xa0Gloria and Jimmy reconcile (“Where I Belong” reprise).', 'Alex decides to leave Pittsburgh and return to the small town where she grew up, despite having no real prospects there. \xa0Nick appears and tries to dissuade her still. She’s insistent that their relationship has too many challenges to succeed. \xa0But when Alex discovers that Hannah has passed away, leaving her some money toward her tuition at Shipley, she finally confronts her own fears and makes the choice to reach for her dreams despite the odds (“Try”).', 'Alex arrives at Shipley just in time to audition, and her remarkable dance dispels the judges’ initial skepticism (“What a Feeling”). \xa0Alex is given a place in the new semester; Nick enters with flowers, and Alex, forgiving the past and certain that her acceptance was based on her true talent, presents him with a rose from the bouquet before embracing him joyously.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Sam is a high-powered banker who has control of numerous accounts and millions and millions of dollars. He works with Carl Bruner, a good friend who comes round to the apartment and shares takeaways and beers with Sam and Molly. Molly is an artist, often working from home, hence the need for the large loft apartment. Perhaps the only downside to their idyllic existence is Sam’s inability to tell Molly that he loves her, only ever using the word “ditto.” Out together one night, Sam and Molly are set upon by a mugger, intent on stealing Sam’s wallet. Sam offers him money, but this is not enough for the mugger, Willie Lopez, who is fixated with the wallet, which we later learn contains the passwords to the accounts which Sam has control of. In the struggle that ensues, a shot rings out. As Sam staggers away from Willie, he notices that Molly is crouched desperately over a body. His body. Sam’s body is taken to hospital, where he dies on the operating table. Sam’s ghost is stuck between worlds, confused and alone, until he is befriended by a friendly ghost who explains about his current situation. Sam begins to learn how the spirit world works, but he cannot do the one thing that he needs to do, which is communicate with Molly. Sam finds himself at the parlour of Oda Mae Brown, a dodgy psychic who specialises in conning money our of vulnerable widows. He realises that Oda Mae can hear him and he persuades her to visit Molly. Initially cynical, Molly begins to believe Oda Mae when she tells her private things about her life with Sam. However, in the background, Carl is determined that Molly should not believe Oda Mae. Sam follows Carl to the flat of Willie Lopez, believing that he is going to confront him, only to discover that the mugging was at Carl’s instigation, with the purpose of obtaining the passwords and transferring money from Sam’s accounts to his. Molly finds it harder and harder to cope with Sam’s loss and, despite Carl’s best efforts to help her to forget her fiance, Molly sinks further into her grief. Meanwhile, Sam is working to thwart Carl’s plan. With the help of a ghost on the subway, he learns how to move objects with the power of his mind, before beginning to haunt Carl, typing the word “murderer” onto his computer screen. Of course, Carl does not see Sam, so is traumatised by this turn of events. Sam persuades Oda Mae to help him once more, this time to become a fictitious account customer, the owner of an account that Carl has created as part of his scam. As “Rita Miller”, Oda Mae enters the bank and makes a withdrawal, with Sam giving her pointers to stop her real identity being revealed. Oda Mae can’t believe her ears when she is told that she is about to withdraw $10 million and leaves, somewhat unsteadily, with a bankers cheque made out to this amount. Oda Mae considers what she is going to do with her newfound wealth, but Sam makes her give the money away. They return to Molly, just in time before Carl arrives, desperate for the cheque that “Rita Miller” has withdrawn. In the struggle the ensues, Carl dies and is consumed by the shadows of death. Sam and Molly realise that is time for them to say goodbye for the last time. Sam thanks Oda Mae and, for the first time, is able to tell Molly that he loves her, before ascending up into the light of happiness and eternal life.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Perhaps the only downside to their idyllic existence is Sam’s inability to tell Molly that he loves her, only ever using the word “ditto.” Out together one night, Sam and Molly are set upon by a mugger, intent on stealing Sam’s wallet. Sam offers him money, but this is not enough for the mugger, Willie Lopez, who is fixated with the wallet, which we later learn contains the passwords to the accounts which Sam has control of. In the struggle that ensues, a shot rings out. As Sam staggers away from Willie, he notices that Molly is crouched desperately over a body. His body. Sam’s body is taken to hospital, where he dies on the operating table. Sam’s ghost is stuck between worlds, confused and alone, until he is befriended by a friendly ghost who explains about his current situation. Sam begins to learn how the spirit world works, but he cannot do the one thing that he needs to do, which is communicate with Molly. Sam finds himself at the parlour of Oda Mae Brown, a dodgy psychic who specialises in conning money our of vulnerable widows. He realises that Oda Mae can hear him and he persuades her to visit Molly. Initially cynical, Molly begins to believe Oda Mae when she tells her private things about her life with Sam. However, in the background, Carl is determined that Molly should not believe Oda Mae. Sam follows Carl to the flat of Willie Lopez, believing that he is going to confront him, only to discover that the mugging was at Carl’s instigation, with the purpose of obtaining the passwords and transferring money from Sam’s accounts to his. Molly finds it harder and harder to cope with Sam’s loss and, despite Carl’s best efforts to help her to forget her fiance, Molly sinks further into her grief. Meanwhile, Sam is working to thwart Carl’s plan. With the help of a ghost on the subway, he learns how to move objects with the power of his mind, before beginning to haunt Carl, typing the word “murderer” onto his computer screen. Of course, Carl does not see Sam, so is traumatised by this turn of events. Sam persuades Oda Mae to help him once more, this time to become a fictitious account customer, the owner of an account that Carl has created as part of his scam. As “Rita Miller”, Oda Mae enters the bank and makes a withdrawal, with Sam giving her pointers to stop her real identity being revealed. Oda Mae can’t believe her ears when she is told that she is about to withdraw $10 million and leaves, somewhat unsteadily, with a bankers cheque made out to this amount. Oda Mae considers what she is going to do with her newfound wealth, but Sam makes her give the money away. They return to Molly, just in time before Carl arrives, desperate for the cheque that “Rita Miller” has withdrawn. In the struggle the ensues, Carl dies and is consumed by the shadows of death. Sam and Molly realise that is time for them to say goodbye for the last time. Sam thanks Oda Mae and, for the first time, is able to tell Molly that he loves her, before ascending up into the light of happiness and eternal life.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Sandy recounts her version of the fling to the ‘Pink Ladies’ (Jan, Marty, Frenchy, and Betty Rizzo), while Danny tells the Boys (Roger, Doody, Sonny, and Kenickie) his rendition (“Summer Nights”). Sandy and Danny soon bump into each other at school, and while Sandy is happy to see him, he plays it cool. Meanwhile, the kids gather in the hall as Doody shows off his new guitar. The rock star wannabe gives an impromptu concert in the hall (“Those Magic Changes”). At Marty’s pajama party, the girls experiment with wine, cigarettes, and pierced ears, and talk about boys. Marty tells about her long-distance courtship with a Marine (“Freddy, My Love”). Meanwhile, the Burger Palace Boys are busy stealing hubcaps and teasing Kenickie about his new (used) car (“Greased Lightning”). Danny sees Sandy again and tries to apologize for his behavior, but she is hurt to find out that he has told his friends that she is “easy.” Head cheerleader Patty Simcox interrupts to prompt Sandy to join the squad and to tease Danny about his latest indiscretions (“Rydell Fight Song”). The kids take their newfangled portable radios for a rock and roll picnic in the park and plan how they will pair off at the upcoming school prom, while Roger shares his love for Jan and his favorite hobby (“Mooning”). Rizzo teases Danny for falling for a girl who resembles the excessively proper teenage ingénue, Sandra Dee (“Look at Me, I’m Sandra Dee”). Sandy realizes that Danny is putting her off to be cool and wishes she had never met him. Then Danny suggests that Marty go out with Eugene, and she chases after him.

Kenickie dumps his blind date, Cha-Cha DiGregorio, and pairs up with Rizzo. Danny and Cha-Cha then proceed to win the dance contest (“Born to Hand Jive”). A few days later at the Burger Palace after school, a couple of the guys run into Frenchy, who flunked out of Rydell and has now dropped out of beauty school (“Beauty School Dropout”). Danny, who has taken up running in order to win back Sandy’s affections, does not know that Cha-Cha’s boyfriend’s gang has challenged the guys to a rumble. He is more concerned about patching things up with Sandy at the Twi-Light Drive-In, but he moves too fast for her, and she leaves (“All Alone at a Drive-In Movie”). A couple of days later, the “greasers” are having a party in Jan’s basement, as Doody and Roger sing “Rock ‘n’ Roll Party Queen.” Rizzo is worried that she is pregnant, but she is so mad at Kenickie that she tells him he is not the father. Rizzo rejects the kids’ offers of help, especially Sandy’s (“There Are Worse Things I Could Do”). Sandy wonders what she needs to do to fit in at Rydell (“Look at Me, I’m Sandra Dee Reprise”). The next time Sandy meets up with the Burger Palace Boys and the Pink Ladies, she has transformed herself into a greaser’s dream date (“All Choked Up”). Rizzo reveals that she is not pregnant, and she and Kenickie reunite. All ends happily (“We Go Together-Reprise”).']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Tommy DeVito arrives, introduces himself and explains how the song is a cover of The Four Seasons’ “December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)”. He offers to tell the story of the band, explaining how he started out with the group “The Variety Trio” with his brother Nick DeVito and friend Nick Massi, eventually discovering teenager Frankie Castelluccio and taking him under his wing, teaching him everything he knows (“The Early Years: A Scrapbook”). During these early years Nick Massi helped train Frankie to sing, Tommy went in and out of prison, Frankie changed his last name to Valli, Tommy and Frankie developed a good relationship with mob boss Gyp DeCarlo, and Frankie fell in love with and married Mary Delgado. Musically, the band was still struggling and kept changing their name and sound but without any dramatic success. One day friend and fellow Jersey boy Joe Pesci comes up to Tommy and says that he knows a singer-songwriter who’d make the perfect fourth for their band: Bob Gaudio.', 'Summer ', 'Bob Gaudio takes over the narration, telling the audience that no matter what Tommy says, he wasn’t plucked from obscurity by him, since he already had a hit single with “Short Shorts”. Bob goes with Joe Pesci to see the band perform, and is immediately impressed by Frankie’s voice. Bob performs a song he’d just written: “Cry for Me” on piano, which Frankie, Nick Massi and then Tommy joining in with vocals, bass and guitar respectively. They negotiate an agreement, though Tommy is at first skeptical that Bobby (then still a teenager) will be good for the band. The band eventually gets a contract with producer Bob Crewe but only to sing back-up (“Backup Sessions”). Crewe insists that the band has an “identity crisis” and needs to make a firm decision on a name and a sound. The band name themselves after The Four Seasons bowling alley, and Bobby writes them three songs that finally propel them to stardom: “Sherry”, “Big Girls Don’t Cry” and “Walk Like a Man”. In the wake of their success, Bob also chalks up a personal first by losing his virginity (“December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)”). The band’s success means that they tour a lot more, along the way discovering the girl band The Angels (“My Boyfriend’s Back”). Unfortunately, the constant touring strains Frankie’s marriage to Mary, and they eventually divorce (“My Eyes Adored You”). The band continues to enjoy chart successes (“Dawn (Go Away)”) until after a concert the band is approached by a loan shark out to claim money owed by Tommy (“Walk Like a Man (reprise)”).', 'Act II ', 'Fall ', ""Nick Massi, taking over as Narrator, explains that Bob was so focused on the band’s musical success and future that he couldn’t see that the band had been in trouble for some time. Tommy’s been racking up debts, and a forgotten bill during a previous tour lands the band in jail over the weekend, which strains things between Tommy and Bob (“Big Man in Town”). Nick observes that Tommy became jealous of Frankie’s success and closeness with Bobby, and attempted to seduce Frankie’s new girlfriend Lorraine. The two never confronted each other about it, but the old friendship was not what it used to be. When the loan shark approaches the band for the $150,000 owed by Tommy, Frankie goes to Gyp DeCarlo for help despite Tommy’s insistence that he doesn’t need it (“Beggin'”). The band, Gyp, and the loan shark come to agreement: Tommy is to be “sequestered” in Las Vegas where the mob can keep an eye on him, and the band will willingly cover the debt, along with an additional half a million in unpaid taxes that Tommy kept hidden from the group. At this time, Nick declares that he’s tired of everything and wants out (“Stay/Let’s Hang On!”)."", 'Winter ', 'Frankie takes over narration, explaining that though he owes Tommy a great deal, he’s aware that their relationship wasn’t ideal, and he never understood why Nick decided to leave. Frankie and Bob find replacements to keep the band a quartet (“Opus 17 (Don’t You Worry ‘Bout Me)”) until Bobby announces that he’s never been comfortable in the spotlight and that Frankie should be a single, i.e. Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. In his personal life, Frankie’s relationship with his daughter Francine is strained and he breaks up with girlfriend Lorraine (“Bye, Bye, Baby (Baby, Goodbye)”). Frankie continues to have success thanks to Bobby’s songs, and hits jackpot with (“C’mon Marianne”) and the almost-never-released (“Can’t Take My Eyes Off You”) which Bobby fights to get airplay for. Along with the success of “Working My Way Back to You”, Frankie and Bobby finally finish paying off Tommy’s debts, and Frankie’s life is good until his daughter Francine dies from a drug overdose (“Fallen Angel”) Finale Bob Crewe describes The Four Seasons’ 1990 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which reunited the original four members on stage one last time (“Rag Doll”). Each member takes a moment to address the audience in turn, explaining his pride at having been with the band and briefly notes what he did afterwards (“Who Loves You”).']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Huey Calhoun, a white man, arrives on the scene. The regulars begin to leave, but Huey convinces them to stay, claiming he is there for the music (“The Music of My Soul”). Later, Huey is about to be fired from his job as a stock boy at a local department store, but he makes a deal with the owner – if he can sell 5 records by playing them over the speakers, he can have a sales job. Huey plays a Rock and Roll hit (“Scratch My Itch”). He sells 29 records in a matter of minutes, but the store owner fires him anyway, incensed at the type of music being played.', 'Huey returns to Delray’s club, and begins flirting with Felicia, Delray’s talented sister, and promises to get her on the radio (“Ain’t Nothin’ But a Kiss”). Huey then proceeds to apply for DJ jobs at various local white radio stations. One of the owners, Mr. Simmons, invites him in, saying he’ll show him what a ‘real’ DJ looks like. Huey hijacks the mic, and plays another African-American rock song (“Everybody Wants to be Black on Saturday Night”). Mr. Simmons is about to have Huey thrown out, but then dozens of teenagers start calling in demanding more of Huey and his music. Mr. Simmons agrees to give him a two week trial, and if he’s successful he’ll get hired full time. After a few days Huey is told to read an advertisement for beer, but he is illiterate. Huey asks Bobby, a friend of Delray’s with a janitor position, to tell him what it says. He forgets the exact words almost immediately and begins to improvise, ending with the phrase “Hockadoo!”. Mr. Simmons again almost fires Huey, until the manager of the store advertised calls in saying that he wants Huey to do all of his advertisements, seeing as his stock sold out in minutes.', 'Huey’s station gains immediate popularity, as does his new catch phrase, even though no one understands what it means – including Huey. While on the radio, Huey encourages white people to go down to black churches (“Make Me Stronger”), and they begin to. Meanwhile, Delray has saved enough money to put Felicia’s voice on the record, and she travels to Huey’s house to tell him this. He is overjoyed and promises to play it the next day. Huey’s prejudiced mother, however, breaks the record, which leaves Felicia heartbroken, but Huey tells her to come down to the radio station anyway (“Colored Women”). The next day, Huey brings in a band and back-up singers to play for Felicia live. Despite her reservations, Felicia sings and becomes an instant sensation (“Someday”). Felicia and Huey’s relationship begins to grow, and Delray is becoming more and more infuriated with Huey. He warns him of the danger of what he is doing, threatening to harm Huey if anything happens to Felicia (“She’s My Sister”).', 'Huey’s radio popularity grows more and more as white teens and black teens begin to accept each other (“Radio”). Huey and Felicia have been carrying on a secret relationship since the day she sang live on the radio. Two years later Huey proposes to Felicia on the way to a party at Delray’s. She says no because of laws and prejudice, but admits that without those obstacles she would accept. As the two share a kiss, a gang of white men pass by, spotting this. They hold Huey down as they beat Felicia with a bat. Huey manages to carry her into the club, crying out for help. Delray tries to go after Huey, for he promised to harm Huey should Felicia get hurt because of him, but Gator, a friend who has not spoken since he saw his father lynched as a child, calms him and sends out a prayer for change as Delray takes Felicia outside and gets her into the ambulance they called (“Say a Prayer”).', 'Act 2 ', 'Time has passed, and Huey is about to open his new TV show, a rock and roll variety show featuring all African American dancers (“Crazy Little Huey”). Felicia is supposed to be his first guest, but she backs out at the last minute, fearing that people will think her and Huey to be in a relationship. Huey informs Bobby that he will fill in, and after getting over some jitters, Bobby brings the house down (“Big Love”). Felicia’s popularity is also beginning to grow around Memphis, as does her relationship with Huey. Felicia tells Huey that if they went to New York they wouldn’t have to sneak around all the time, but Huey insists that they are happy the way they are and don’t need to leave (“Love Will Stand When All Else Falls”). She has been discovered by a talent agency in New York, as has Huey’s TV show. The agency wants them both to come up to New York, although Huey has to compete with a local Philadelphia DJ, Dick Clark for the national show. They ponder the decision (“Stand Up”), and are even supported by Huey’s mother, who has changed her racist ways after seeing an African American church choir (“Change Don’t Come Easy”).', 'Huey is told he has won the TV position, if he agrees not to use African American dancers. Huey refuses, and proceeds to strip out of his suit on the air (“Tear Down the House”). Felicia tells Huey that she plans to go anyway, as it is her dream. In a desperate attempt to keep her, he kisses her on the air, and says he loves her (“Love Will Stand/Ain’t Nothin’ But a Kiss” (Reprise)). The feed is cut, and Huey is fired on the grounds that no one would watch his show if they knew about him and Felicia, and that he wasn’t the only white person to play black music anymore.', 'Felicia is taken away by Delray in an attempt to save her career. Now unemployed, Huey leaves the station and ponders his relationship with Memphis, realizing he couldn’t leave for any reason (“Memphis Lives in Me”). Four years later, Huey is a DJ on an obviously low budget and low rated station (he jokes that they have “exactly one listener”). Felicia walks in, about to start a national tour. She tells Huey that she is engaged to a man named Bill, but that she wants him to join her on stage one last time. He refuses, afraid that no one will remember him. She begins her performance, and halfway through the song Huey walks on stage, and finishes the song with her to thunderous applause. He then proclaims “The name is Huey Calhoun. Goodnight and HOCKADOO!” (“Steal Your Rock and Roll”).']","{'sets': ['NETworks Productions – National Tour Sets/Costumes', 'Prop Rentals NY', 'Memphis Props', 'Phone: (516) 459-0106', 'John@proprentalsny.com'], 'costumes': ['Broadway Costumes 1100 West Cermak Road · Second Floor Chicago · Illinois · 60608 · USA 800-397-3316'], 'props': []}"

An idyllic Scandinavian village appears, with gaily dressed Finnish villagers singing and dancing to the “Fisch Schlapping Song.” The Historian returns, irritated, and tells them he said “England”, not Finland. The villagers disperse and the pastoral forest is immediately replaced by a dreary, dark village with penitent monks in hooded robes chanting Latin prayers and hitting themselves in the face with wooden boards. King Arthur travels the land with his servant Patsy (“King Arthur’s Song”), trying to recruit Knights of the Round Table to join him in Camelot and his quest for the Holy Grail. He encounters various strange people, including a pair of sentries who are more interested in debating whether two swallows could successfully carry a coconut than in guarding their castles. Sir Robin and Sir Lancelot meet as they attempt to dispose of the sickly Not Dead Fred (“He Is Not Dead Yet”). They agree to become Knights of the Round Table together. Meanwhile, Arthur attempts to convince a peasant named Dennis Galahad that he (Arthur) is king of England because the Lady of the Lake gave him Excalibur, the sword given only to the man fit to rule England. However, Dennis and his mother, Mrs. Galahad, are political radicals and deny that any king who has not been elected by the people has any legitimate right to rule over them. To settle the issue, Arthur has the Lady of the Lake and her Laker Girls appear to turn Dennis into a knight (“Come With Me”). Cheered on by the girls (“Laker Girls Cheer”), the Lady of the Lake turns Dennis into Sir Galahad and together, they sing a generic Broadway love song (“The Song That Goes Like This”). Together, with Sir Bedevere and Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Show (a knight resembling Don Quixote who promptly apologizes and then leaves), they make up the Knights of the Round Table (“All for One”). The five knights gather in Camelot, a deliberately anachronistic place resembling Las Vegas’s Camelot-inspired Excalibur resort, complete with showgirls and oversized dice (“Knights of the Round Table” / “The Song That Goes Like This (Reprise)”). In the midst of their revelry, they are contacted by God (voiced by John Cleese) who tells them to locate the Holy Grail. Urged on by the Lady of the Lake (“Find Your Grail”), the Knights set off. They are viciously taunted by lewd French soldiers at a castle they come to, and attempt to retaliate by sending them a large wooden rabbit in the style of the Trojan Horse; however, they realize after the fact that it was not as simple as leaving the rabbit and walking away – they were supposed to be inside of it. Defeated, they leave in a hurry when the French begin throwing various barnyard animals – including cows – at them (“Run Away”).', 'Act II ', 'Sir Robin and his minstrels follow King Arthur and Patsy into a “dark and very expensive forest” where they are separated. King Arthur meets the Knights who say Ni, who demand a shrubbery. King Arthur despairs of finding one, but Patsy cheers him up (“Always Look on the Bright Side of Life”) and they find a shrubbery shortly after. The Knights accept it, but next demand that King Arthur put on a musical and bring it to Broadway. The Black Knight appears but King Arthur more or less defeats him by cutting off both his arms and legs, impaling his still-alive torso on a door, and leaving to find Sir Robin. Sir Robin, after wandering the forest for some time (“Brave Sir Robin”), finds King Arthur and insists that it would be impossible for them to accomplish this next task (“You Won’t Succeed on Broadway”). King Arthur and Patsy promptly set off in search of Jews. While the Lady of the Lake laments her lack of stage time (“The Diva’s Lament”), Sir Lancelot receives a letter from what he assumes is a young damsel in distress. He is a little surprised to find that the damsel is actually an effeminate young man named Herbert (“Where Are You?” / “Here Are You”) whose overbearing, music-hating father, the king, is forcing him into an arranged marriage. Lancelot advocates for Herbert after the king returns, and Lancelot is outed as a homosexual in the process (“His Name Is Lancelot”). King Arthur begins to give up hope of ever putting on the Broadway musical and laments that he is alone, even though Patsy has been with him the entire time (“I’m All Alone”). The Lady of the Lake appears and tells Arthur that he and the Knights have been in a Broadway musical all along. All that’s left is for King Arthur to find the Grail and marry someone. After picking up on some not-too-subtle hints, Arthur decides to marry the Lady of the Lake after he finds the Grail (“Twice In Every Show”). Reunited with his Knights, Arthur meets Tim the Enchanter who warns them of the danger of an evil rabbit. When the rabbit bites a knight’s head off, Arthur uses the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch against it, knocking down a nearby hill and revealing that the “evil rabbit” was actually a puppet controlled by a surprised puppeteer. A large stone block showing a combination of letters and numbers is also revealed. After pondering the final clue, Arthur admits that they’re “a bit stumped with the clue thing” and asks God to “give them a hand”. The grail is “found”; Arthur marries the Lady of the Lake (who reveals that her name is Guinevere); Lancelot marries Herbert; and Sir Robin decides to pursue a career in musical theatre (“Act 2 Finale/ Always Look on the Bright Side of Life (Company Bow)”).']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

The musical is bashed by\xa0The New York Times\xa0because Dee Dee and Barry do not understand their characters since they are too self involved, resulting in the show closing on opening night. To improve their image, the actors decide to take up “a cause” to appear selfless. They team up with two other actor friends, Trent Oliver, who is an actor and\xa0Juilliard School\xa0graduate down on his luck but who has just been cast in the\xa0non-Equity\xa0tour of\xa0Godspell, and Angie Dickinson, a life long chorus girl who just quit her job of 20 years in the musical\xa0Chicago\xa0after the producers never let her go on for the role of\xa0Roxie Hart. After searching on Twitter for a cause, they find the story of Emma, a teenager from Indiana who got her school’s prom cancelled because she wanted to bring her girlfriend. Seeing the opportunity, and some personal connection, the actors decide to go to Indiana to help (“Changing Lives (Reprise)”).', 'Back in Indiana, Emma faces severe bullying, but she reminds herself to breathe and that not everyone is this cruel (“Just Breathe”). Mr. Hawkins, the school principal and Emma’s ally, informs her that he has spoken to the States Attorney and that he believes they have a good shot. The school holds a meeting with the PTA to discuss having the prom. As Emma and Mr. Hawkins begin to make progress, Dee Dee, Barry, Angie, and Trent barge in with protest signs to support Emma. Dee Dee reminds everyone what a good person she is for doing this while claiming that this isn’t about her humiliating Emma (“It’s Not About Me”). After the meeting, it is revealed that the girl Emma wants to take to prom is Alyssa, a popular but closeted student and the daughter of the head of the\xa0PTA. The two argue as Alyssa blames Emma for all the publicity around the prom but Emma reassures her that she didn’t want this either and that she just wants to be with her (“Dance with You”). The actors attempt to hold a rally to inspire action for Emma but can only book the halftime show at a monster truck rally. They perform alongside the non-Equity cast of Godspell that Trent is on tour with (“The Acceptance Song”). The performance is unsuccessful.', 'It is later learned that the state’s attorney ruled that the school must hold a prom. Emma thanks the actors, and Mr. Hawkins and Dee Dee go to\xa0Applebee’s\xa0to celebrate. With the prom back on, students begin to “prompose” to each other. Emma officially asks Alyssa to this new prom and she agrees promising to\xa0come out\xa0to be with her (“You Happened”). At Applebee’s, Mr. Hawkins, a huge fan of Dee Dee’s, tells her how much she inspires him (“We Look to You”). Barry helps Emma get ready for prom and reveals he didn’t have the opportunity to go to prom either. Meanwhile across the town other teens prepare for the prom as well (“Tonight Belongs to You”). As Emma waits outside the gym, she asks Barry to walk her in because she is nervous. As they enter, they realize that the gym is empty. Mr. Hawkins, who is inside desperately trying to resolve the issue, reveals that the PTA put on another prom across town and this one just for Emma as required by law. Dee Dee panics that this fake prom will be bad press for her, which angers Mr. Hawkins as he learns about Dee Dee’s true intentions. Emma calls Alyssa who tells her she knew nothing about the other prom. Emma asks her to come and be with her but she refuses to come out. Devastated, Emma runs out of the gymnasium, asking all the actors to just go home (“Tonight Belongs to You (Reprise)”).', 'Act II', 'Following the fake prom, the media frenzy around the whole event increases. The actors encourage Emma to step up and become the face of the story, but she is too scared. Angie encourages her by teaching her about zazz, a technique from a story about\xa0Bob Fosse\xa0and the original production of\xa0Chicago\xa0(“Zazz”). Dee Dee returns to talk to Mr. Hawkins, who berates her for being so self centered. She performs his favorite song by her to make it up to him and vows to begin thinking of others (“The Lady’s Improving”). Trent decides that he may be able to change the minds of the youth of the town due to his small-town upbringing. He confronts a number of the students about how they and their families break the word of the Bible every day and how hypocritical they are being. He encourages them to follow “love thy neighbor” above all (“Love Thy Neighbor”).', 'Alyssa meets with Emma to apologize, telling her about all the pressure her mother puts on her to be perfect and that she blames her for her father leaving. Emma is unable to accept her apology and they break up (“Alyssa Greene”). The actors book Emma a TV appearance, but she refuses, telling them that she has her own plan to control the narrative and change minds. Convinced her plan will work and that they will be able to have a prom for everyone, Emma asks Barry to be her date so that he is finally able to fulfill his dream. Barry, overjoyed, agrees as he recounts his own experience missing prom the first time (“Barry Is Going to Prom”). Emma uploads a video of her singing with her guitar about her struggles and longing for acceptance but how despite that she is proud of who she is and won’t hide anymore. She inspires other members of the\xa0LGBTQ+ community in the area and across the country to comment on their support for her and how it has helped them (“Unruly Heart”). The video goes viral, forcing the school to reconsider. The actors want Emma to finally have a prom but the school doesn’t have the money for it.', 'The actors all donate, including Dee Dee, who turns over her\xa0American Express\xa0Black\xa0card. The PTA is furious over the possibility of a new prom but the students voice their support for an inclusive prom, having had their minds changed by Trent. The school, seeing how good Trent is with the kids, offers him a position as a drama teacher. Alyssa comes out to her mother in front of the school, confessing her love for Emma. Mrs. Greene is reluctant to accept Alyssa as she is, but Barry steps in, saying if she doesn’t accept Alyssa she is going to lose her. She is devastated but begins to become more open and agrees to listen to her daughter. The PTA backs down, and quickly makes plans for a new prom, while Dee Dee and Barry question what “success” is. The school puts on this more inclusive prom and LGBT couples from the area attend along with the straight couples of James Madison High School. Emma and Alyssa finally get their dance and share a kiss (“It’s Time to Dance”).']","{'sets': ['White Plains Performing Arts Center', 'Contact Stephen Ferri, Executive Producer', 'stephen@wppac.com', 'www.wppac.com', ''], 'costumes': [], 'props': ['Prop Rentals NY', 'THE PROM Props', 'Here’s a direct link to the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award props, available at PropRentalsNY', 'Phone: (516) 459-0106', 'John@proprentalsny.com', '']}"

He flees his underground home, emerging to take in the air and ends up by the river, a thing he has never seen before. Here he meets Rat who spends all his days in, on and close by the river. Rat takes Mole for a trip in his rowing boat, and as he shares his picnic an enduring friendship is born (“MESSING ABOUT IN A BOAT”). Mrs Otter gate-crashes the friends’ picnic looking for her daughter Portia who has a habit of wandering off in search of food. Rat and Mrs Otter warn Mole about the inhabitants of the Wild Wood and tell him of wise but solitary Badger who lives there and of the extraordinary amphibian, Mr Toad (“SPEED IS OF THE ESSENCE”).', 'As the Swallows return marking the beginning of summer (“ONE SWALLOW DOES NOT A SUMMER MAKE”), Mole and Rat visit Toad Hall at the request of Mr Toad (“TOAD’S ENTRANCE”). Mr Toad is rich, jovial, friendly and kind-hearted, but aimless and conceited; he regularly becomes obsessed with current fads, only to abandon them abruptly. Having recently given up boating, Mr Toad’s current craze is his horse-drawn caravan. He persuades the reluctant Rat and willing Mole to join him on a trip (“THE OPEN ROAD”). Having parked at the roadside for an overnight stop, a passing\xa0motor car\xa0scares the horse, causing the caravan to overturn into a ditch. Rather than be upset Mr Toad changes his obsession again and now focuses on the new-fangled motor-car (“SPEED IS OF THE ESSENCE REPRISE”). In his new racer, he terrorises his neighbours, particularly a family of nervous Hedgehogs (“THE HEDGEHOG’S NIGHTMARE” / “THE AMAZING MR TOAD”). \xa0', 'Determined to save Mr Toad from himself, Mole insists Rat and he venture into the Wild Wood to call on the support of Badger. When Rat refuses, Mole ventures on the scary road alone (“THE WILD WOODERS”). Pursued by the Chief Weasel and his Wild Wooders, Mole only escapes when Rat has a change of heart. Unfortunately falling leaves of autumn have covered the path to Badger’s house and the two are lost in the Wild Wood (“AUTUMN”). When Mole injures himself on a sharp piece of metal, Rat realises they have accidentally stumbled on Badger’s doorstep. As Badger invites them in, Chief Weasel calls his gang of Wild Wooders and tells them of his plot to steal Toad Hall so they can live the good-life. Portia, still looking for food, is kidnapped by the gang.', 'Inside Badger’s house, Mole and Rat convince Badger to come to Mr Toad’s aid (“A FRIEND IS STILL A FRIEND”). The trio arrive at Toad Hall to find that Mr Toad has ordered a new car after yet another crash and set out to guard him in his bedroom until he learns some sense. Mrs Otter arrives and when she begs the friends to help her find Portia, Mole suggests he looks after Mr Toad whilst the Rat and Badger join the search. Feigning illness, Mr Toad escapes Toad Hall, and steals a beautiful new car (“TOAD’S ESCAPE”).', 'Act One ends with Mr Toad in the dock (“AS IF IN A DREAM”) being judged by a jury of stoats and weasels.', 'Act Two', 'With Toad in prison, the Wild Wooders have taken over Toad Hall and are fattening up Portia, readying her for a feast to come (“WE’RE TAKING OVER THE HALL”). In prison, Mr Toad gains the sympathy of the Gaoler’s Daughter, who helps him to escape disguised as a washerwoman (“TO BE A WOMAN”). Walking through the Wood, Rat and Mole discuss the imprisonment of their friend when they come across Mole’s home. Homesick, having realised he hasn’t returned since the day he left his Spring cleaning, the friends have a humble feast (“A PLACE TO COME BACK TO”) when local choristers appear (“THE WASSAILING MICE”). As the choristers’ song ends, Badger bursts in to let Rat and Mole know that Mr Toad is now a criminal on the run. They set off again to save him from himself.', 'Though free again, Mr Toad is pursued by the police. Mr Toad flags down a passing car, which happens to be the very one he stole earlier. The car owner, not recognising Mr Toad in his disguise, permits him to drive the car. Once behind the wheel, he is possessed by his former passion and drives furiously, declaring his identity to the owner who tries to seize him leading to yet another crash (“THE GREATEST GREAT ESCAPE”).', 'Badger discovers Toad at the doors of Toad Hall. Badger and friends tell Mr Toad that Toad Hall has been taken over by\xa0weasels\xa0and\xa0stoats\xa0from the Wild Wood and even worse, that Portia is imprisoned inside. After Mole convinces two guards that an attack on the Hall is imminent Badger announces that he knows of a secret tunnel into Toad Hall through which the enemies may be attacked (“HUSH”). Badger, Mrs Otter, Rat, Mole and Mr Toad enter via the tunnel and pounce upon the unsuspecting Wild Wooders who are holding a celebratory party and about to cook Portia (“THE FIGHT”). Having driven away the intruders, Mr Toad holds a party to mark his return, but can he really change? (“FINALE”)']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Christmas break. Peter, an altar boy, falls asleep during the Priest’s homily and drifts into a nightmare in which he is “outed” by statues of saints, his mother, and his classmates (“Epiphany”). On his way to class after Mass, Peter finds his roommate and clandestine boyfriend, Jason, who tries to assuage Peter’s frustration about their relationship (“You and I”). Peter asks Jason to audition for the senior play, a production of Romeo and Juliet, so they can spend more time together, but Jason refuses. The bell rings without Peter getting his desired kiss, and as he watches Jason walk away, Peter reflects on their relationship (“Role of a Lifetime”). At auditions that afternoon, Sister Chantelle, the school’s no-nonsense drama teacher, is underwhelmed by the acting candidates—until Jason surprises Peter by showing up (“Auditions”). Jason and Matt, another altar boy, battle for the role of Romeo. Sister Chantelle awards the role to Jason, and Ivy, the senior class’s most beautiful girl, is his Juliet. Peter is Mercutio, Matt is Tybalt, and Jason’s acerbic twin sister, Nadia, is cast as the nurse. Jason stays to console his sister, who wanted the role of Juliet (“Plain Jane Fat Ass”). She opens a letter she’s received from their father, revealing that Jason has been accepted to Notre Dame, his first choice of schools.', 'In study hall, Matt tries to plan a small surprise gathering for Ivy’s birthday while Lucas, St. Cecilia’s resident party boy, tries to recruit everyone to go to a rave (“Wonderland”). In his best white boy rap, Lucas introduces the students to two drugs: K and GHB. The night of the rave, Nadia decides not to go, after seeing the skimpy attire on Ivy and the attention it’s generating from Matt. When everyone leaves without her, Nadia takes out her cello and spends another quiet night by herself (“A Quiet Night at Home”). At the rave, Peter dances closer to Jason while Ivy dances closer to Matt (“Rolling”). As Peter goes in for a public kiss, Jason pulls him outside. They argue over the nature of their relationship, Peter wanting to be more open, Jason telling him that the rave is different from school (“Best Kept Secret”). Peter finally gets his kiss; it’s not public, but it is, unbeknownst to them, witnessed by Matt.', 'The following morning, the groggy students gather for their least favorite St. Cecilia’s activity: confession (“Confession”). Peter comes close to telling the Priest how he feels, and Matt comes even closer to telling him what he saw. At first rehearsal that afternoon, Sister Chantelle realizes she has her work cut out for her. During a break, Nadia jokes about Ivy’s promiscuity, causing Ivy to reflect on the image the students have of her (“Portrait of a Girl”). The intimate party Matt was planning to impress Ivy gets commandeered by Nadia, who turns it into a full-scale bash (“Birthday Bitch!”). Peter stuffs his face with brownies, not realizing they’re pot brownies, and begins flirting openly with Jason. Ivy, drunk, also flirts openly with Jason, and when Jason chooses Ivy over Peter to protect his image, Peter storms off. Ivy dismisses Matt’s advances, concentrating her energy on landing Jason. She asks for a kiss for her birthday, and Jason reluctantly agrees (“One Kiss”). Both Matt and Peter retreat to the solace of the church’s chapel, where they ask God for answers (“Are You There?”). Matt then seizes the opportunity to ask about the “nature” of Peter’s relationship with Jason. Peter, still high from the brownies, confesses all to Matt, desperate to talk about his confusion. When Matt abruptly leaves, Peter realizes what he has done, but is stopped when he has a second “vision” in the church: Mother Mary, appearing in the guise of Sister Chantelle. She and her two angel sidekicks tell Peter it’s time to tell his mother his secret (“911! Emergency”).', 'At rehearsal the following day, Jason and Matt’s fight scene turns real, and they have to be separated (“Reputation Stain’d”). Peter tells Jason about the vision he had, and that he wants Jason to go home with him over spring break so Peter can tell his mother about them. Jason’s had enough, and breaks up with Peter (“Ever After”). As students pack to go home for spring break, Nadia sings a self-penned ode to spring (“Spring”). Peter leaves wordlessly with his mother, as Ivy shows up at Jason’s dorm to apologize for throwing herself at him at her party. When Jason suggests that he enjoyed kissing her, Ivy goes in for more, and Jason gives in. As Peter misses Jason, Matt pines for Ivy, and Nadia begs to be noticed, Jason has sex with Ivy in his dorm room, hoping this is the right thing to do (“One”).', 'ACT II', 'Act Two opens in the church, where the scene is set for an elaborate gay wedding. Peter is dreaming again, this time about making his relationship with Jason official (“Wedding Bells”). After Mass, class ranks are posted; Jason has once again bested Matt, walking away with the valedictorian spot. Ivy wonders why Jason hasn’t called, telling him that she has, for the first time, fallen in love (“Touch My Soul”). Jason, realizing that Ivy is describing the exact feelings he has for Peter, breaks things off, devastating her. Peter phones his mother to finally tell her his secret. But she won’t let him say the words, continually changing the subject (“See Me”). She hangs up on him, but she knows what he wanted to tell her. Alone, she wonders how to deal with what to her is a confusing and earth-shattering revelation (“Warning”).', 'With two weeks to go before the show, Ivy misses yet another rehearsal, claiming illness. Sister Chantelle asks the understudy to read with Jason, but she can’t remember her lines. Peter steps in, and for a moment, all is perfect, as he dances with Jason (“Pilgrims’ Hands”). Ivy finally shows up, breaking the spell. Sister Chantelle cancels rehearsal, and tells the students they are on their own for rehearsing—she’s through. Ivy begs Jason to talk to her, and he agrees to meet her before the student-led rehearsal that evening. As students move to exit, Sister Chantelle tells Peter to stay. She knows what’s bothering him—and tells him that he’s exactly as God intended him to be (“God Don’t Make No Trash”). When Nadia returns to the dorm room, she confronts Ivy about missing rehearsal, assuming she’s moping about Jason breaking up with her. They argue, and Ivy reveals the true reason she’s been missing rehearsal: she’s pregnant (“All Grown Up”). Ivy leaves and finds Jason practicing his valedictory address in the auditorium, and there she tells him her news. As Jason reels from the revelation, he wonders whether this is exactly what he wanted all along. He tells Ivy that maybe he does, in fact, love her, but at that moment, Matt steps out of the wings and reveals Jason and Peter’s relationship. Peter shows up, then Nadia, and then the entire cast is revealed, having heard everything (“Promise”).', 'With nowhere to turn, Jason goes to the priest to ask the question that has tormented him for years—does God still love him? When Jason presses the priest for an answer, the priest ultimately condemns him (“Cross”). Jason returns to his dorm room and watches Peter sleeping peacefully (“Once Upon a Time”). As the students lead vocal warm-ups for the show, Lucas passes out their afterparty drug orders (“Two Households”). As the show is about to begin, Jason pulls Peter aside and makes a plea: run away with him. Peter tells Jason he’s done running. Jason nods, knowing it’s finished; just before going on, he takes a lethal dose of GHB. As everyone moves into place, Jason pulls Peter aside to tell him he loves him; the share a final kiss (“Bare”), and the play begins.', 'As the play unfolds, Jason becomes increasingly disoriented. During the Queen Mab speech, he loses his place completely and begins to hallucinate (“Queen Mab”); this segues into the masked ball scene, where Jason has increasing difficulty keeping time as the players switch partners, and he collapses, reaching for Peter as he dies (“Glooming Peace”). Peter visits the confessional, confronting the Priest about his final visit with Jason. The Priest asks Peter for forgiveness, which Peter grants (“Absolution”). At graduation, Peter, Matt, Ivy and Nadia struggle to process Jason’s death, trying to understand it and wondering whether they could have prevented it. As the senior class of St. Cecilia’s graduates, the chorus of students crescendos and they move forward into a world that offers more questions than answers (“No Voice”).']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': ['Prop Rentals NY', 'Phone: (516) 459-0106', 'John@proprentalsny.com']}"

The school bell rings for summer and a group of schoolchildren spill out of the schoolhouse, eager for the afternoon adventures that await them. (“What We Get Up To”). In the local woodland, we meet a group of friends as they play and argue together. William (16), Beagle (14) and Jack (11) attempt to humanely trap animals, much to the annoyance of Gladys (12), Sybil (15) and Florence (8). It takes the arrival of William’s sister, Frances, to calm the situation, until the trap the boys were laying is set off. Fortunately, they have safely caught Felix (14), a new boy in the town (“How To Catch A Beast”). Felix is welcomed by the gang and speaks to Florence about her Father who is away at war (“My Dad”).', 'Back in the town, we meet the cruel Gripper (16) and his gang as he bullies little Jimmy Biggs (11). Frances and some of the gang arrive just in time to stop a vicious beating (“Truth & Justice”). After this encounter, the gang hear about a screening of The Battle of the Somme film which they agree to all attend. This leaves Frances concerned about the impact of the war (“Frances Thinks”). At the screening of the film, the gang are horrified by the reality of war and realise that if it comes to it, they will stand together and fight off any evil (“Then We’ll Fight”).', 'The following day, in an attempt to get involved, the gang try dressing up as adults to enlist at the recruiting office (“Recruitment & Rejection”). Only William is successful. Gripper has been observing and figures out Felix is in fact German. Thinking him a spy he declares that as soon as William is gone, he will take Felix down (“Felix Found Out”).', 'A few weeks later and William is about to leave for the army (“William’s Farewell”). Beagle relishes in the chance to become the leader of the gang with his pet mouse, Mousey, by his side (“Beagle’s Gang”).', '(“Together Rising”) The children return to school after the summer. Gripper seizes this moment to challenge Felix on his heritage who admits, he is half-German. Gripper and the gang brutally beat Felix and Beagle putting them in hospital (“Tyranny”). The gang receive a letter from William. His words inspire them to double their efforts to get to France to join in the war effort (“No Vengeance”).', 'Once Beagle and Felix have healed. The gang attempt to break into a military base to stow away on some transport to France. They are unsuccessful (“Sneak”). After this latest failed attempt, Frances is feeling completely lost, William is out in the trenches and finding life very tough (“Helpless”). Beagle comes up with the idea of building his own Zeppelin to fly the gang to France. He has even built a prototype for Mousey to try (“Zeppelin”). The gang receive another letter from William, they find it heartbreaking they have been unable to get to him. When Beagle presents his failed Zeppelin to the group, he discards it in a barrel which has been collecting water from a leak. It floats and an idea is formed (“Broken Promises”).', 'ACT 2', 'Hidden away in the wood, the gang have built their very own boat to sail themselves to France. They are introducing it to Jimmy Biggs who will help keep it hidden from the community. Beagle has named the vessel, “Boat”. (“The Birth of Boat”)', 'Back at school Gripper is desperate to find out what they have been doing. He tries to torture Jack for information but to no avail. Frances and the girls arrive and confront him, he finally backs off. In a final moment of anger, Gripper grabs Mousey from Beagle and crushes him (“Oppression”). The gang hold a funeral for Beagle’s little friend (“Funeral For A Friend”). They are joined by many of the local children who have come to pay their respects. Afterwards, Frances and the girls warn Beagle not to retaliate (“A Warning”).', 'Despite agreeing to behave, Beagle, Felix, Jack and Florence hatch a plan to avenge their fallen friend (“Avenge”). The four of them stalk Gripper, ready to attack him once he is alone. There is no opportunity, so they instead opt for a childish prank before returning to the hideout of Boat (“Punch O’Clock”). They did not however realise, they had been followed by two of Gripper’s gang. After trying to convince them otherwise, these two girls run back to Gripper with full knowledge of Boat. On hearing the news, the rest of the gang plan to get to sea as quickly as possible (“Boat Discovered”).', 'On returning home that evening, Frances finds Gripper and his gang waiting for her. He tells her they are coming to destroy Boat (“White Feather”). After they have gone, Frances decides they will use their cunning as defence (“Plan”). William is in the trenches, battleworn. He still worries for his friends back home (“Resolve”).', 'Gripper’s gang arrive to destroy Boat. They are faced with Florence and her cakes. Some of the bullies steal and eat them, but they make them ill. The Defenders use this distraction to attack. They are overpowered however and Gripper is about to set fire to Boat when Jimmy Biggs arrives and lures him into a trap. The Defenders make a final stand. Once again, they are beaten but before Gripper can do any damage, Beagle knocks him out. The rest of the bullies flee and the gang rush Boat to sea (“The Battle Of Boat”).', 'Out on the sea and Boat is holding up well until a storm hits. Beagle is thrown overboard and lost to the sea. Boat is destroyed but the rest of the gang manage to make it back to the shore (“The Sea Was Angry”). They are horrified by the incident, though thankfully Beagle has made it back to shore alive.', 'A few months later and Frances contemplates their failure. The gang arrive with a letter from William containing surprising news. Tales of their courageous efforts have made it to the trenches where they have become a huge morale boost for the troops (“Morale”).', 'Frances finally realises it wasn’t all for nothing, it was all for hope.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

She is fiercely independent, refusing help or support from anyone, and she’s always there with a quip or smart remark.', 'HARVEY (50’s to 60’s; baritone, should have range to an F# or a G): The resident “tummler” (comedian/social director) at Esther’s Paradise, Harvey is old-school Catskills.

But her plans backfire when Del mistakenly assumes that Marge’s father can further his ambitions to become the next teen heartthrob on American Bandstand. Gazing forlornly at Marge from the wings is geekish cabana boy and aspiring songwriter Gabe. When he isn’t entertaining the guests with classic, but still comical Borscht Belt shtick, house comic Harvey secretly carries a torch for widowed resort owner Esther, who is more preoccupied trying to keep her resort open.

God muses, “Perhaps innocence isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.”', 'Scene 2: Night in the Garden of Eden.\xa0 God (He) catches Eve looking out at the desolation beyond the garden.\xa0 When a sparrow flies out past the borders, Eve asks God what’s beyond Eden, a question that troubles God.\xa0 He realizes that Adam and Eve are “only human” and are going to need some help getting the human race going.\xa0 He therefore gives Adam and Eve a second gift: choice – and puts the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the garden.\xa0 As they drift off to sleep, Eve and then Adam obsess over the new tree.\xa0 Why would God put a tree in their midst and tell them not to eat the fruit?\xa0 However, Adam and Eve withstand temptation and settle down to sleep.\xa0 The angels Michael and Sarah commend God for how obedient Adam and Eve are for withstanding temptation, but God replies, “They haven’t been tempted enough.”\xa0 He sends Michael and Sarah back to Adam and Eve to tempt them further, telling them to “act like a bit of snake.”\xa0 Michael and Sarah tempt Adam and Eve singing “I’ve Got Plans For You,” and Eve, getting caught up in the moment, bites the apple.\xa0 Then Adam…doesn’t.\xa0 Suddenly creation is way off track.\xa0 God (She) realizes she has to be true to her word and casts Eve out of the paradise, leaving Adam alone in Eden.', 'Scene 3:\xa0 Eve, finding herself alone in the brutal world of mortality, sings “Where Will I Sleep Tonight?”\xa0 She cuts her hand on a jagged rock and sees, for the first time, blood drip from the wound.\xa0 She realizes she is no longer of the heavens, but of the earth.', 'Scene 4:\xa0 In the heavens, Sarah and Michael are dumbfounded.\xa0 “She didn’t eat the freakin’ apple,” Sarah says.\xa0 They go to God and singing, “Now What?”\xa0 In response, God (She) goes to Adam and tells him that because Eve is mortal, she will feel the pain of loneliness more profoundly and will soon return.', 'Scene 5:\xa0 Curious, Sarah returns to Earth and finds Eve.\xa0 She asks Eve about what it was like to bite the apple, but all Eve wants is to see Adam again.\xa0 Eve asks Sarah for help, but Sarah refuses, saying they’re not allowed.\xa0 Eve tells Sarah she’ll describe what the apple tasted like if she’ll help her.\xa0 Sarah takes Eve to a place where can see Adam, but can’t speak to him.\xa0 The three sing, “There’s a Space Next to Me,” describing Adam’s loneliness, Eve’s regret and Sarah’s curiosity about being human.\xa0 God (She) appears and breaks up the meeting.\xa0 She tries to cheer up Adam, telling him that once things are sorted out, the world will get back on track, singing “Good Things Are A’ Comin.’”', 'Scene 6:\xa0 Eve begins to explore the wonders of the world, discovering mountains, seasons, and oceans.\xa0 As she travels and her knowledge expands, she begins to realize that perhaps Eden isn’t paradise after all; perhaps this world is.', 'Scene 7:\xa0 In the heavens, Michael and Sarah point out to God that it’s been twenty-one years since Eve left, and she’s becoming less interested in coming back to Eden.\xa0 At his wits end, God goes Adam with a plan to fix things: he’ll make Adam a new woman to take Eve’s place, saying, “I will give unto thee a new woman.\xa0 And her name shall be…Nicole.”\xa0 At first, Adam’s thrilled with the idea, but as he describes exactly what he wants, it becomes clear that no other woman, not even Nicole, can take the place of Eve.', 'Scene 8:\xa0 God, fed up with the whole problem, ponders the possibility of just destroying them…then, seeing Eve in pain, decides against it and goes to her. At first, God is surprised when she looks in Eve’s face.\xa0 “You’re the first person who’s aged,” God says.\xa0 God tells Eve if she’ll repent, she’ll let Eve back into the garden.\xa0 While she still doesn’t understand the whole point of putting a fruit in the garden for them not to eat, Eve tells God she’s sorry, and God lets her return to Eden.\xa0 Eve joyously rejoins Adam in the garden.\xa0 At first they’re thrilled to be together again, but when Eve asks Adam to kiss her, the distance between them becomes apparent.\xa0 Eve needs the passion of an earthly love, something Adam still doesn’t understand.\xa0 “Oh, Adam, they things I know now, and the things you don’t.”\xa0 Eve realizes she can no longer stay in Eden and leaves. Adam angrily calls for God, who, despite the urging of Michael and Sarah, refuses to answer him.\xa0 “I’ve done all I can,” God says.\xa0 Finally, Michael and Sarah have had enough, they go to Adam and tell him, “Adam, you’ve got to bite the apple so the human race can start.”\xa0 When he asks them why, they tell him, “Because we’re in love,” and until they can have human bodies like Eve’s they can only love in an angelic, ethereal, boring way.\xa0 “But you’ll die if you do,” Adam tells them, then asks, “You’d actually be willing to sacrifice that for each other?”\xa0 “No,” they say, “we’d be willing to sacrifice more.” Adam finally realizes he needs Eve more than obeying God and more than the safety of the garden and bites the apple.\xa0 He immediately feels the weight of mortality and the heartache of missing Eve for twenty-one years. Overcome, he rushes to find her.\xa0 When he does, Eve tells Adam, “Oh, Adam, I’ve figured out that paradise isn’t in Eden.\xa0 Paradise is out here in the world.” Adam answers, “No Eve, you’re wrong,” and as the lights dim on the worlds’ first two lovers, he sings, “Paradise is you.”']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

But how? He’s not very bright, not very rich, and not very cool, unlike his neighbor, airplane pilot Big Jack Preston. Plus, Jerry is so dyslexic he can’t even drive a car. The neighbors think he’s nuts. But Gracie encourages Jerry to quit his job and follow his “Jerriosity.” Together, Jerry and Gracie try flight school, the Up With People Space Program, and anything else they can think of to help Jerry soar into the stratosphere. But they are stymied by bureaucracy, Jerry’s disapproving mother, and deep, dark family secrets.', 'Finally, when all seems lost, Jerry and Gracie hit on a highly unorthodox method of getting airborne. With a little help from a lawnchair and 400 helium-filled toy balloons, Jerry defies the odds and takes to the friendly skies. Once aloft, Jerry is thrilled by the splendor of flight. But his reverie is quickly halted when Big Jack flies by in a jumbo jet, spots Jerry in his floating lawnchair, and reports Jerry to Homeland Security. Meanwhile, Gracie is on the ground with a walkie-talkie fending off the media and an FAA Agent, who charges Jerry with piloting an unlicensed lawnchair and demands he land immediately. Oblivious to the commotion on the ground, Jerry rises higher into the glorious atmosphere, where he discovers Leonardo Da Vinci, Charles Lindbergh, and Amelia Earhart, who urge him to join the greats of aviation in the sky. In the end, Jerry has a decision to make: come back down to earth, or fly forever where the air is free.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

As soon as the audience is settled, a warm-up man named Steve Fox comes out to encourage everyone to have a good time, and to make them understand that GAME SHOW is about to air LIVE. Moving throughout the audience, Steve talks with some audience members and auditions others to read the introduction for GAME SHOW\xa0star and host, Troy Richards. Among those moving behind the cameras are Ellen Ryan, the show’s producer, Johnny Wilderman, a production assistant with a sharp memory, and two veteran cameramen named Joe and Gerry.', 'Once the\xa0“live”\xa0television show begins, an audience member announces the show, Troy enters, and the first four volunteers from the audience are chosen to play for prizes. But tonight’s show takes an unexpected turn. Troy has an important announcement to make. Although\xa0Game Show has been a top-rated television show for 15 years, Troy shocks the audience (as well as the producers and crew) by announcing that this will be his final season. At this point, the “game” in GAME SHOW\xa0begins. Some questions are quite easy, while others are intended to stump most of the audience. But all of the questions are fun and entertaining. The winner of Round I moves to The Winner’s Circle to await the playoff. Then GAME SHOW\xa0cuts to its first commercial break.', 'When we get to the first commercial break, many of the audience members are so involved in the quiz program they have forgotten that there is a play still to be revealed. During the commercial break the drama begins. Was Troy’s announcement a tactic to get more money out of the network? Was Ellen really surprised by Troy’s on-air resignation? Can Steve be trusted? Why do the cameramen have a hidden video camera? Is Johnny really as naïve as he seems? There are many soap-opera like plot twists in GAME SHOW still to be revealed. The rest of the 90-minute show follows the same pattern: a round of the quiz program interspersed with political maneuverings, seduction and betrayal during the commercial breaks. To offer anymore information at this time will ruin many surprises.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Attractive, but not a classic beauty. Spunky, rough and tumble, passionate, and quietly internal by turns.', 'OLIVIA (late 20’s – 30’s: legit soprano, with ability for a strong jazzy low belt): a noblewoman of Illyria. Stunningly beautiful, elegant, poised, but willing to cut loose and be sexy and silly as well.

Sexy, clever, in charge, able to be “one of the boys”, a sparkplug. Has a long, on-going affair with Sir Toby, with whom she is in love and shares a real chemistry and penchant for mischief.', 'SEBASTIAN (20’s; tenor, needs to belt to an A): obviously, should be a strong physical match for Viola, but with his own, very masculine energy.

We also meet the passionate and self-indulgent Duke Orsino, ruler of the land. In the midst of these comic introductions, a violent storm shipwrecks the twins Viola and Sebastian off the coast of Illyria. Viola makes it to shore, but cannot find her brother. Distraught, she decides to assume his identity for her safety in an unknown territory. Dressed as a boy and calling herself Sebastian, Viola enters into service of the Duke Orsino, who is unrequitedly smitten with the Countess Olivia. The two immediately hit it off, and the Duke sends his new manservant “Sebastian” to plead his suit to Olivia, even as Viola finds herself beginning to fall for her new master the Duke.', 'Meanwhile, at Olivia’s house, Feste returns after several years spent abroad. He is shocked to find Olivia still in mourning for her brother, his late master, and sets about bringing mirth into the household once again. He teases Maria about her longstanding flirtation with the debauched Sir Toby, and re-ignites a rivalry with Malvolio. Although Countess Olivia has been refusing all visitors, after Feste’s intervention she decides to receive Viola, and is very taken with the pretty youth. As Viola returns to the Duke to report on this encounter, Malvolio catches up with her and gives her a ring, a gift from Olivia. Viola contemplates the implications of this gift, even as the real Sebastian, who has also survived the shipwreck, returns to Illyria with his rescuer, Antonio. Later that night at Olivia’s house, Feste, Toby, Sir Andrew, and Maria are all at odds with Olivia’s stuffy steward, Malvolio, who squelches their midnight revels. The four plot a delicious revenge to humiliate the priggish steward.', 'At the same time, across the island at the Duke’s palace, romantic sparks fly between Viola and Orsino as they drink wine and share thoughts on love. Alone again, Viola vows patience, despite the impossible situation created by her disguise as a boy. However, tempers flare the following morning as the Duke learns that Viola has kept the gift of Olivia’s ring a secret, and he once again dispatches Viola to Olivia to press his suit. Meanwhile, Maria sets her revenge plot in motion by penning a “secret admirer” letter to Malvolio, cleverly written to seem as if it came from her mistress the Countess, and leaves it for him to find. The letter instructs Malvolio to show that he returns her affections by dressing and acting outrageously. Viola, in her second audience with the Countess Olivia, definitively discovers that the lady is now in love with her rather than her master, and has come undone. As the first act draws to a close, Viola, Olivia, and Orsino lament their seemingly hopeless situations.', 'As Act 2 begins, we see that Maria’s letter has had the desired effect: Malvolio makes lascivious advances towards Olivia, while dressed garishly in cross-gartered yellow stockings. Olivia believes him mad, and has him taken away by Sir Toby. With the real Sebastian’s arrival on the scene, the comic plot becomes increasingly outrageous. He presents himself at the Duke’s palace, and Orsino mistakenly declares his feelings of love to the real Sebastian, rather than Viola. Taken aback, Sebastian flees the Duke’s palace for Olivia’s house, and is once again mistaken for the “Sebastian” being impersonated by his sister (who he believes is dead). Both twins become entangled in a ridiculous duel with the cowardly Sir Andrew, which has been set-up through a scheme of Maria’s and Toby’s. Olivia rescues the real Sebastian from the duel, and romance ensues. Though confused, Sebastian willingly accepts the Countess Olivia’s love.', 'Meanwhile, Malvolio has been imprisoned as a lunatic after behaving outrageously before Olivia, and pleads with Feste to release him – or at least carry a message to the Countess. Eventually, through an extended, madcap musical sequence, the twins are re-united and the misunderstandings are resolved. The Duke is matched with Viola, Olivia with Sebastian, Toby with his partner in crime Maria. Even the much-wronged Malvolio is somewhat consoled, and Feste and the full cast bid the audience farewell.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Upon arriving to her apartment Austin finds Catherine in bed with another man. Dejected, Austin goes to his local bar, where his brother, Jeff, the eternal bachelor, tries to cheer Austin up by telling him the best way to win a woman back is by being completely indifferent to her in, “Oh, What A Difference”. Meanwhile, Marcy, a flighty photographer, laments to her best friend Diana, about her difficulty in finding the perfect man. Diana, being an actuary, tells Marcy that the best way to find the perfect man is to find a man who is absolutely wrong, which she proves through a series of calculations in “The Actuary Song”. Jeff sets up a double date for himself and Austin, where Austin meets Marcy for the first time. In an attempt to be indifferent to Catherine, he tries to win over Marcy. Austin tries to tell Marcy of his sensitive side, but continually ambushes himself by bringing up his ex-girlfriend in “But I Don’t Want to Talk About Her”.', 'Jeff’s courtship of Diana goes notably better until Jeff throws out his back in a bedroom accident and is rushed to the hospital. Marcy is convinced that Austin would make a perfect rebound man, and after trying to track down Austin for many weeks, Marcy finally corners him at the coffee shop across from the hospital, where Austin sits writing. Marcy discovers that Austin is now trying to win Catherine back by writing her the perfect poem. Marcy tries to keep Austin from writing a cliché laden greeting card poem. She shows him that the lack of romance in his ordered and mannered way of life is evident in how he takes his “Coffee”. Austin calls Catherine, and when her response is all that Marcy predicted it would be Austin agrees to let Marcy help him.', 'Marcy tries to teach Austin the difference between the clichéd romance of a greeting card and the honest romance of a poem in “The Perfect Romance”. He learns well, but Marcy tells him not to send the poem for six months. However, Jeff accidentally sends the poem early. The response from Catherine comes on a post card that Marcy intercepts. She takes Austin out for dinner so that she can break it to him gently. Austin has a bit too much to drink and finally grasps all of Marcy’s lessons of saying what you honestly feel. He explodes at the waiter when he tries to charge Marcy too much for dinner. Austin feels liberated, and Marcy feels like someone actually stood up for her. They both feel a way they haven’t before, and they tell each other in “Because of You”. However, just as their song builds to a kiss, Marcy breaks the news about Catherine to Austin. Crushed, Austin blames the failure on Marcy, who turns on Austin and yells that the reason for his failure is his insistence on having a completely ordered and structured life. This fight ends with the two sleeping together.', 'Meanwhile Jeff and Diana come to an understanding that they express to each other in “We’re Just Friends”. After sleeping with Marcy, Austin runs home and tells Jeff that he might be in love with Marcy. Jeff warns Austin that he is letting his emotions get the better of him, and that he should keep his feelings to himself. Austin debates what he should do in “Maybe We Just Made Love”. Ultimately Austin runs off and tells Marcy how he feels, but she is not ready to feel the same way, and she tells Austin so in “Just Not Now”. Austin returns home to find Catherine waiting for him. Marcy wanders the streets of New York thinking about what she has done. The ensemble appears and helps Marcy convince herself that she is better off “Alone”.', 'Diana tires of her and Jeff’s “friends with benefits” situation, and asks Jeff to become exclusive. Jeff warns her that becoming exclusive will only end in heartache in “That’s What’s Gonna Happen”. Marcy decides that she does return Austin’s affections even though he is so wrong for her. She tells him so in “Even Though”. Austin, now back with Catherine, still hurt by Marcy’s earlier rejection, and reeling from her tactless attempt to apologize, sends her away.', 'Austin, Marcy, Diana, and Jeff, all deal with their heartache in “But I Do”. Marcy and Diana go to the bar where the Bartender and Cocktail Waitress lament with them in “What Do We Do It For?”. Austin returns home and finds Diana and Jeff making up. They convince him that Marcy is the woman for him in “Marcy’s Yours”. Before running to Marcy, Austin takes a moment to say goodbye to his old life in “Goodbye”. Austin runs off to find Marcy, and tells her that she is completely wrong for him, and he is completely wrong for her, and he doesn’t love her anyway. He loves her because of their differences. Austin and Marcy lead the ensemble in the finale, “I Love You Because”.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

In this version, Noah, a lonely and precocious little boy, is introduced to the wonders of astronomy by a solicitous carpenter who is doing installations for the boy’s parents, a never-seen financier father and an order-obsessed mother.', 'In “The Brick,” the second show on the bill, young Darius, visiting relatives in the green hills of Connecticut, is introduced to the gritty black-and-white world of old gangster movies by his film-buff aunt, who is bored and restless in the time-honored manner of fictional suburban wives. She gets to cut loose, though, in a dance sequence that riffs drolly on Balanchine’s “Slaughter on Tenth Avenue.”', 'And in the title segment, the show’s most poignant, the adoption of a too-perfect boy by two gay men becomes a mystical contemplation on the ephemerality of love. Each plot has a twist that turns the tone from blithe to somber — and in two cases from natural to supernatural — via the application of textbook irony. And each is steeped in a wistful whimsy that courts preciousness and may wear thin for theatergoers of heartier tastes.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

He lives with his mother, father, and sister in Suburban Long Island. There’s nothing all that spectacular about his life but for one thing: Jimmy draws comic. In the Amazon jungle of Jimmy’s imagination, Jimmy’s characters are in peril (“Doin’ Fine”). In the climactic moment of the song we hear Jimmy’s Father calling out “Jimmy!” Reality intrudes.', 'The jungle disappears and Father is asking about Jimmy’s delinquent homework and family chores. Charley Bemmer, the slightly older athletic boy from next door, appears and Father and Charley throw a baseball around. This joyful athletic moment reminds Father what Jimmy is not, in addition to reminding Father of his own inadequacies (“Almost There”).', 'Uncle Lester – Mother’s brother – is a struggling songwriter only moments away from his first big hit. Father calls Lester “Mr. Floperoo.” Lester is currently struggling to write the perfect love song for his newest musical. Jimmy, doing chores, ponders, along with Uncle Lester and, eventually, Father, what life could be like with a big hit show (Lester’s wish) or with Father’s attention on comics (Jimmy’s wish) or with an athletic boy (Father’s wish). They begin a song (“Jimmy”) that also introduces Mother and Lisi (Jimmy’s aggressive-but-loving older sister).', 'At dinner, Father belittles Uncle Lester while Jimmy tries in vain to impress Father with his new comic book. Lisi speaks dismissively about Charley Beemer as Mother distractedly serves dinner while answering a series of calls and texts. Dinner concludes and Jimmy goes to meet up with Charley Beemer.', 'Outside, Charley Beemer is going through Jimmy’s newest comic creation showing little enthusiasm. Suddenly, Charley Beemer has his own idea: The Hand of Doom! An evil hand that flies around doing dastardly deeds. This is not really Jimmy’s thing but Charley Beemer, the most popular boy in school, won’t be denied: Jimmy must write and draw Charley’s ideas and agree to have new pages tomorrow. Jimmy agrees. Alone, Jimmy admits his greatest weakness as an artist: He can’t draw hands (“Hands”). Jimmy calls on imaginary assistants to help him draw all the hands he would ever need.', 'Back at home, Mother and Father keep failing to connect. Mother’s world – interior design – is ordered and, to her, completely understandable. Her husband? Less so. Father’s world is similarly confused. They sing (“Disappear”) as they wonder, separately, if their marriage will disappear because of the troubles they currently face.', 'Jimmy’s cartoon creations are growing impatient with him. Why is he drawing Charley Beemer’s ideas when Jimmy should be drawing and writing his own ideas? His characters spring into action: Each one tries to convince Jimmy to (“Draw Me”) rather than those nonsense Charley Beemer ideas.', 'Charley Beemer is not impressed with Jimmy’s progress on “The Hand of Doom” comic. In fact, he’s downright disappointed. Dismissive, inflated and altogether bossy, Charley decides to give Jimmy one more chance and exits. Jimmy wants to impress his hero and, more, wants to earn his friendship (“Maybe He Likes Me”).', 'Jimmy, at his most vulnerable, is visited by The Man In The Ceiling. Jimmy talks to him, trying to understand why he’s come to visit. Quickly, however, Jimmy ends the conversation: “Could you maybe come back later?” And Jimmy gets his wish. The Man In The Ceiling fades away revealing Uncle Lester at his piano.', 'Uncle Lester is near panic. He hasn’t written his love song. (“Where is My Love Song”). He comes downstairs to share a brilliant new idea with the kids as we turn to Father, reading Jimmy’s recent report card. Jimmy’s grades are bad, and worst of all, he got an F in history. As the song continues, Father angrily sings about how it’s time to set firmer boundaries. In a private moment, Mother adds to this, sharing her thoughts while Charley Beemer sings with assurances to Jimmy that his ideas will yield results. Finally, Jimmy’s cartoon characters beg Jimmy not to give them up in favor of Charley’s Beemer’s ideas. The full company reaches a musical climax as Father bursts into Jimmy’s room, report card in hand, quietly demanding “No more comics.” Jimmy accepts this verdict, but for everyone else it shakes their entire world as they all respond, desperately, “No more comics!”', 'ACT TWO:', 'Hiding under his bed, Jimmy commits to quitting. He crawls out with a big, green garbage bag. Yes. Jimmy wants to throw all his comic book characters out. He’s no longer (“Kidding Around”). No more comics. The comic characters are understandably terrified. However, as Jimmy’s creations, they obey.', 'Father, seeing Jimmy with the garbage bag, is touched and lovingly reminds Jimmy that he’s growing up. Father exits as Jimmy realizes he’s now got to deal with Charley Beemer and tell him the truth. Jimmy disappears as Mother stands, staring at the green garbage bag. Mother can’t contain her dismay as she asks Father to consider who is (“Like Your Son”)? She concludes that Father is the real disappointment of the family, not Jimmy. Not Lester. Father is stunned.', 'Jimmy’s cartoon characters cry out from the garbage bag, one last time, for their very existence, as Lisi drags Jimmy into Uncle Lester’s studio. Lisi reveals everything to Uncle Lester. She unwittingly insults Uncle Lester as she asks him how he can endure, in the face of all the evidence that, well, he’s not really any good. Uncle Lester considers this question seriously and answers (“I Do What I Do”). Lester believes it doesn’t matter what “they”\xa0say about my art: I make it because I love it. And, to prove it, he has unlocked his truest and greatest creation yet: He has written his love song.', 'Lester begins his love song, which is indeed true, deep, and reflective of Mother and Father’s relationship in real life (“You Are the Friend”). The song is like a magical wind spreading through the house, taken up by Mother and Father and the entire family as we transition from the house to the backers’ audition of Lester’s new musical. It is as if the entire family – Father now included – has taken up Lester’s voice.', 'Back at home, as they wait for Lester’s arrival, the family celebrates. Jimmy begins by praising the Inca gods that surely must have had something to do with Lester’s success. Father, with glee, insists they should be nodding instead to the god of Broadway musicals (“To the Gods”). Father also now thinks Lester is a genius! The moment becomes a raucous, old-fashioned Broadway-styled celebration. They finish just as Uncle Lester returns home. Lester stands silently, his face growing strained and ashen, a tear rolling down his face. It’s clear, Lester has flopped again.', 'Jimmy runs out of the room, screaming “No, no, no, no, no!!” Straight to his bedroom he pulls out paper and pens. He’s drawing!! His comic characters, who he failed to actually throw out, start to appear and watch him draw. Who is he drawing? Jimmy is drawing The Man in the Ceiling who, as they talk, gives Jimmy the strength to do what happens next. And what happens next? Jimmy tells Charley Beemer “No”. No, Jimmy will not draw Charley’s ideas. Charley Beemer warns Jimmy there’s a cost: Charley’s friendship. Jimmy, more sure than ever, simply says “No.”', 'Next morning, at the breakfast table, Uncle Lester peruses the “Want-Ads” in the newspaper. The kids, and even Father, try to discourage Lester from giving up songwriting, but Lester is convinced Father was right: Lester is (“Mr. Floperoo”). Jimmy interrupts Uncle Lester by thrusting a drawing in front of him. It stops Uncle Lester cold.', 'It turns out, Uncle Lester’s advice – do what you do – was heeded by Jimmy. Jimmy drew a simple and elegant drawing of a hand. This epic task of every artist – the ability to draw a human hand – has been conquered by this boy, with some serious help from Uncle Lester and The Man in the Ceiling.', 'The family is stunned. Most of all, Father who, finally getting it, starts (“Draw Your Own Conclusion”). Father learned from Jimmy. Now, it’s Uncle Lester’s turn who, inspired, finds himself revived and recommitted to making art. Jimmy has encouraged them all. As they all sing the final chorus of the song, a projection of that beautiful hand is shown high above – proof that Jimmy has indeed solved his own dilemma and, in doing so, brought his family closer together.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Mills']",https://www.theatricalrights.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/olympians-musical.png,,"['CHARACTER BREAKDOWN:', 'Roles may be played by actors of any ethnicity. Diversity in both the gods and the mortals is encouraged, with careful attention to avoiding stereotypes. While a spectrum of gender identities certainly existed in classical Greece as in our present world, the specific group of characters written in THE OLYMPIANS represent binary, cis-female and cis-male gender identities. The expectations, limits, and privileges implied by those traditionally defined gender identities — both for the ancient Greek humans, and the pantheon of Greek gods & goddesses — are central to the conflict of the story. However, the overarching message of this show is about embracing authentic, individual gender identity beyond accepted, traditional constructs. When casting a production, actors of any identity are welcome to represent the characters’ specific identities.', 'THE GODS:', 'ARTEMIS – Female, 20s-30s. Mezzo Rock Belt. Fierce. Idealistic. Goddess of the hunt, wild animals, the Moon, and both chastity and childbirth. Daughter of Zeus and Leto, Apollo is her twin brother. She is the patron and protector of girls. She is angered by the status of women inhuman society and instigates change.', 'APOLLO – Male, 20s-30s. Pop Tenor. A golden boy and a trickster: A charming and charismatic showman, sophisticated and more than a little bit arrogant. God of the sun, archery, truth and prophecy, and healing. Twin brother of Artemis. A frequent companion of the Muses, Apollo presides over all music, songs, dance, poetry. and loves theater. (This actor may be used to double in the ensemble in Act I as needed.)', 'ATHENA – Female, 30s-40s. Alto Belter. A steely cold intellect with a wry wit. The warrior goddess of wisdom (& courage, inspiration, civilization, law and justice, strategic warfare, mathematics, the arts, crafts, and skill.) The daughter of Zeus, she sprang from his head, full-grown and in armor. A problem-solver, she devises the test of three mortal women.', 'APHRODITE – Female, 20s-40s. Soprano Pop / Rock Belt. Empathetic and emotional. Goddess of love, beauty, and desire. Born from the sea, she is also honored as a protector of those who travel by sea. Frustrated that women (including her) are objectified and viewed only as beautiful prizes to be pursued, she wants humans to understand there are many types of love beyond romantic love. Both a mediator, and a troublemaker.', 'THALIA – Female, 30s – 40s. Warmly funny. Audacious. This is not a featured singing role but demands a character actress with strong comedic ability. She is the Muse of Comedy, one of the Three Graces – a second-tier goddess. She serves as a narrator, in a Mrs. Maisel-esque stand-up comic way, instructing the audience and guiding us through the story. Steps into supporting roles throughout, to comic effect. Pronounced: “THA-lee-ya”', 'THE MORTALS:', 'SOPHIA – Female, late teens or early 20s. A small town girl from a long and distinguished line of goat-herders, she secretly studies by day and watches her goats by night and yearns to travel to Athens to study. Smart, but naive. Overthinks everything. Excellent navigator, advanced mathematician, and inventor. Patronized by Athena. She will kill you with her sharp mind but is protective of her emotions.', 'ZOE – Female, late teens or 20s. Daughter of the King of Sparta. Athletic, tough, defiant, competitive, and over-confident at times. Something of a loner. Patronized by Artemis. Like Artemis, she feels no need to be defined by the romantic companionship of a man… or woman, for that matter. Fiercely loyal and protective – something of a Wonder Woman. She will kill you with her sharp sword.', 'ALEXIS “LEXI” – Female, 20s. Slightly older and more worldly wise, she comes from a middleclass family in Athens, and is the daughter of an Athenian citizen – a merchant who sails the seas. Intuitive, compassionate and a true believer in the Power of Love. Patronized by Aphrodite. Her brother is Xander. She struggles with how one person, with little power in society, can make a difference. She will kill you with kindness.', 'XANDER – Male, late teens or early 20s. Lexi’s brother. A kind soul, and charmingly attractive, but a little hapless. He does not want to follow in his father’s footsteps but isn’t sure what else he should be doing in the world. Super helpful and thoughtful, he loves animals. He becomes an ally to the women’s quest and falls for Sophia.', 'ORPHEUS – late 20s – 30s. Baritenor. The mythic musician, now immortalized, a bit older and wiser. Very emotional – subject to high highs and low lows. Ideally plays the guitar and could double in the band throughout. (Actor also may be used in the ensemble throughout Act I.)', 'THE GREEK CHORUS:', 'An ensemble of 4 or ideally more performers who play multiple roles throughout:', 'CITIZENS OF ATHENS, GOATS, LOTUS EATERS, and others as needed for staging. The chorus should include at least 4 strong movers / dancers to play APOLLO’S HORSES, SPARTAN SOLDIERS, and have other featured dance roles throughout. Additionally, there are featured chorus character tracks for a 50s+ woman (who would play both SOPHIA’S GRANDMOTHER and HERA) and a 40s+ man (who would play ZOE’S FATHER /KING OF SPARTA and ZEUS) and various others (GUARDS, DIOGENES).']",https://www.theatricalrights.com/apply-for-a-license/?select-show=the-olympians,"

As female gods, how can they enjoy immortal life when they rule over a society that doesn’t have equal rights for women? What they need is a hero – a female one – to inspire women across the world.

On New Year’s Eve, an over-worked and under-inspired single guy who’s had enough of holiday cheer makes a resolution: to stay home and go to bed early. On another New Year’s Eve, a continent away—and more than a century earlier—Hans Christian Andersen’s Little Match Girl tries unsuccessfully to sell her matches in the snow. The two stories are brought together when a young woman selling special “full-spectrum holiday light bulbs” to combat Seasonal Affective Disorder shows up at the grumpy man’s door.', 'Though the man (who probably could use the bulbs) seems to enjoy the young woman’s company, he sends her away. It’s not until he reads “The Little Match Girl” that he is finally pulled out of his funk. All of this unfolds through a tuneful pop/rock/jazz score that retains the vibrant style of its original performers: the celebrated band, GrooveLily. (The show has since been expanded to 8 or more actors and 6 musicians). The witty and deeply moving script weaves three stories and settings: contemporary New York City, 19th century Denmark, and the very room in which the show is presented. Through simple, unpretentious theater created through the voices and instruments of the performers, Striking 12 reminds us that “the world looks like new… on the first day of the year.”']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

When at last, a dozen years into Prospero’s banishment, Antonio and Alonsa’s ship sails temptingly close, Prospero conjures up a storm—a tempest—to wash its company ashore.', 'The newly marooned Italians bring surprises, like drunken clowns Trinculo and Stephano, who conspire with Caliban, and Alonsa’s sister Sebastia, who nurses murderous intentions. Most astonishing of all, the now-grown Miranda “changes eyes” with Alonsa’s son Ferdinand—an innocent love that shakes Prospero’s certainty. Will ‘justice’ cost the next generation its happiness? Can Prospero interrupt the cycle of betrayal, or will he stay— alone and proud—on this island forever?']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

TENDERLY offers a remarkably personal and poignant picture of the woman whose unparalleled talent and unbridled personality made her a legend.\xa0The show, which received rave reviews and a double-extension of its run in its second incarnation at Cincinnati Playhouse earlier this year, features many of Mrs. Clooney’s signature hits, including “Hey There (you with the stars in your eyes),” “Tenderly,” and “Come On-A My House.”\xa0', 'Mrs. Clooney was born on May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Kentucky. \xa0She became a popular recording artist during the 1950s, known for her warm, engaging voice. \xa0She started out singing with her sister Betty on a Cincinnati radio show, and the two joined Tony Pastor’s touring big band orchestra in 1946.\xa0After her sister retired from singing, Mrs. Clooney went to New York to launch her solo career in 1949. Two years later, after signing with Columbia Records, she had her first No. 1 hit with “Come On-a My House.” \xa0More hits followed, such as “Hey There,” “This Ole House” and “Tenderly.” \xa0', 'She also appeared in feature films, including The Stars Are Singing (1953) and White Christmas (1954) with Bing Crosby. \xa0In the late 1950s, she had her own self-titled television show.\xa0She experienced personal problems in the late 1960s, including a divorce from actor Jose Ferrer, medication addiction, and depression. She spent years recovering and rebuilding her career, starting out in small clubs and lounges. \xa0In the mid-1970s, she joined Bing Crosby on his final tour, which helped spur her comeback. \xa0She later signed a recording contract with the Concord Jazz label and married Dante DiPaolo, a dancer she had known from two of her films, in 1996.\xa0Mrs. Clooney continued to record and perform, and in 2002 received a Grammy Award for Lifetime Achievement. \xa0Mrs. Clooney died from complications related to her battle with lung cancer on June 29, in Beverly Hills, CA.

The small cast is broken down as follows: 5 girls, 1 adult female (who plays two roles), and 4 boys, 1 adult male (who plays two roles, one being a dog)', 'Expanding the WANDA’S WORLD Cast: The cast list below outlines the expanded cast (with an asterisk * indicating added roles). Specific notes explaining how we added/adapted some of these roles are included. If you follow along with the script while looking at the list, it should be clear how you can make similar adjustments to suit the needs of your talent pool.', 'THE CAST (in order of Vocal Part):', 'SPANGLES: Our Spangles was played by a boy, but it could also be a girl. SPANGLES is Wanda’s loyal dog, but in her fantasy, he is the charismatic announcer of her TV show and the rock star who boosts her courage in “Don’t Mess With Me.” This actor also doubled as a student in the ensemble.', '*WANDA’S DREAMGIRLS: A trio of singer/dancers who are like Wanda’s “Supremes” in her fantasy TV show. As part of her fantasy, they are there to support Wanda and react to the callers. They sang the first stanza of the opening number, and then the rest of the ensemble joined them (wearing robes and underdressed with school clothes). WANDA’S DREAMGIRLS also sang the opening lines in scene 7 (we changed it to “give HER a call”, and added harmony). In “Don’t Mess With Me”, they sang “Well are you gonna take it” before the rest of the dancers entered.', 'WANDA BUTTERNUT: This role requires the most versatile and honest actress/singer you can find. A few technical notes: 1) Find a good makeup artist to experiment with birthmark makeup (red, blue, purple) under the lights you’ll be using.\xa0 Be sure the birthmark “reads” well to the back of your auditorium; 2) Give WANDA plenty of rehearsal time with her wig in the opening number. It needs to cover the birthmark in her fantasy sequences, and she needs to be able to put it on and take it off quickly.', 'CALLER #1: Cocoa Beach – “blend equals friend” girl, in opening AND scene 7 & 16', 'CALLER #2: Bethlehem, PA – “pack snacks” girl, in opening AND scene 7 & 16', 'CALLER #3: Madison, WI – “take control” girl, in opening AND scene 7 & 16', 'JAKE: Wants to be an athlete, but clearly isn’t. It is funny if he is awkward in some way.', 'ETHAN: Our ETHAN happened to be a tap dancer, so in the football scene where he played the Cheese Valley Cow mascot, he performed a funny tap solo.', 'TY BELVEDERE: The audience has to believe that the girls would go crazy for this boy.', 'MEGHAN: To expand JENNY’S clique, we reassigned MEGHAN’S “Totally” lines (repeated throughout the show) to the added character of TINA. CORY: We reassigned her “Tell me about it” lines to TASHA. (see below)', '*BECKY: An added member of JENNY’S clique.\xa0 Hears the gossip from CORY in “No One Can Know.” Smarter than the others in the clique.', 'P.J. DUNBAR: Our PJ was really short, which added to the comedy of this strong character.', 'JENNY HIGHTOWER: The only change we made regarding JENNY is that we reassigned her lines in “She’s So Last Week” so that all the girls in her clique had solos.', '*TINA: Added member of JENNY’S clique. Idolizes JENNY. Always says “totally” after JENNY says something she thinks is cool. Screams when she’s excited. A gum chewer.', '*TASHA: Added member of JENNY’S clique. Obsessed with her own hair. Very critical of others, especially WANDA. Always says “tell me about it” after TINA says “totally.”', 'MS. DINGLEDERRY: We had an adult actress in the role. Requires maturity, sensitivity and humor.', 'MR. LEMMINGS: We had an adult actor in the role. Needs to be a father figure to WANDA.', '*JOCKS: A clique in the Ensemble', '*SKATERS: A clique in the Ensemble', '*CHEESE VALLEY GLEE CLUB: Six strong harmonizers (“Glee” geeks) who sing the theme song at the beginning the school TV show.', 'ALISON CARMICHAEL: Very dull candidate for student council president. Different from the other girls. Book-smart but socially awkward and nerdy. Tries to act very professional.', '*EMILY: ALISON’S best friend and personal assistant for her presidential campaign. Clumsy and nervous under the pressure of the campaign. Emily doesn’t have “lines” but can whisper and have intensely private conversations with ALISON. They are a comical pair.', 'CHEERLEADERS: JENNY’S clique. Add as many others as you want, and have uniforms & pompoms for.', '*CHUCK: Football commentator:(instead of MR. LEMMINGS, in Scene 9)', '*VAL: Football commentator:(instead of MS. DINGLEDERRY, in Scene 9)', 'CALLER #4: Hot Springs , AR – “hot-guy-noticed-me girl” in scene 11 & 16', 'CALLER #5: “Am I fat?” girl in Finale', 'CALLER #6: “Flush head down toilet” wimpy boy in Finale (in our production, he hung out with ALISON & EMILY throughout the show)']",https://www.theatricalrights.com/apply-for-a-license/?select-show=wandas-world,"

She is its “way cool, way beautiful, way talented” host and she gives awesome advice aided by her faithful dog and co-host, Spangles.\xa0 “Caller Number Three” confesses that she has a terrible birthmark on her face.\xa0 Wanda suggests that she cover it with makeup, but the caller says that makeup doesn’t work.\xa0 Wanda tells her that she has to be perfect in every other way “right down to the ring tone on your cell phone”. Wanda’s mother interrupts her fantasy, “Wanda, time for bed!”\xa0 She reminds Wanda that she has to get up early to put on her makeup. Wanda touches the birthmark on her cheek and responds despondently,\xa0 “Mom, it doesn’t work anyway!”\xa0 Spangles licks her face to comfort her and coaxes her to continue her show, “You can’t let down Caller Number Three!”', 'The next day, the halls at Cheese Valley Middle School are abuzz with the news that school heartthrob, Ty Belvedere, “like-likes” the leader of the girls’ clique, Jenny Hightower. (“No One Can Know”). Too busy with their gossiping, no one even notices Wanda who is desperately searching for her classroom.\xa0 When she finally makes it to Spanish Class, Señorita Dinglederry begins to scold her for being late. Then she sees The Birthmark.\xa0 So do the kids. They gasp.\xa0 Dinglederry becomes overly solicitous.\xa0 Wanda is miserable. At lunch, as a joke, Jenny invites Wanda to sit with her and her clique. She pretends to befriend her “so what are you ‘into’, Wanda?” Flattered, Wanda confesses that she’s very interested in becoming involved with the school TV channel. Behind her back (and later to her face) Jenny and the other girls criticize everything about Wanda, and call her a “freak.” (“She’s So Last Week”) The girls drop Wanda and go wild when heartthrob, Ty Belvedere, appears. Jenny and Ty express their confidence that it’s going to be a very good year.\xa0 Class bully, P.J. Dunbar, knocks into Wanda on purpose causing her to drop her tray adding to her embarrassment. A couple of weeks later, in Audio Visual class taught by Mr. Lemmings (who doubles as the Vice-Principal) Wanda is given the job of holding cue cards for the Cheese Valley News. She drops them and feels she can’t do anything right. On air, Jenny is the host. She introduces Alison Carmichael and Ty Belvedere who announce their candidacies for student council president. Ty explains why he should be elected (“What’s Not To Like?”).\xa0 After the class, P.J. tells his buddies that he is sick of Ty.\xa0 P.J. also “like-likes” Jenny but she won’t give him the time of day. P.J. decides that he’s going to run for president against Ty, vowing that he will bring Ty Belvedere down by manipulating the hapless Wanda, (“Operation Shutdown”.)', 'Meanwhile, Wanda’s show goes awry… None of her advice has worked for her fantasy callers, and they are complaining. She threatens to cancel the show. A rock star appears and challenges her to stand up for herself.\xa0 (“Don’t Mess With Me.” ) Wanda continues to work very hard in the TV production class and begins to excel partly due to all the practice on her imaginary TV show.\xa0 Mr. Lemmings rewards her by giving her the plum assignment of covering the big football game for School News Channel 23! Jenny is furious about this and accuses Wanda of being the “teacher’s pet.” After all, the star quarterback is Ty Belvedere! Nevertheless, Wanda takes her assignment very seriously and covers the game – (“Blow Them Away.”) Although nobody else notices, she sees that Ty is limping slightly during the game. Despite the injury he is trying to hide, he scores the winning touchdown and saves the day for Cheese Valley.\xa0 After the game, Wanda rushes in for an interview but Jenny blocks her way.\xa0 Surprisingly, P.J. sticks up for Wanda.\xa0 He suggests that Wanda go to Ty’s house to get her story.\xa0 She balks at first, but P.J. and his cronies convince her that it’s a good idea. Timidly, Wanda approaches Ty and interviews him with her video cam in his backyard. His knee is very swollen and now Ty is panicked – fearing that he won’t be able to continue playing sports and live up to his brothers’ hero legacy.\xa0 Due to Wanda’s innate skill, he is able to confide on camera.\xa0 Hiding out in the bushes, the nefarious P.J and his buddies snap photos of Wanda and Ty in close proximity. After the interview, Ty asks Wanda if she is going to vote for him for student body president.\xa0 He is shocked when she says she’s not sure. He asks why and she explains that she wants to vote for someone who realizes not everyone is the same.\xa0 For example, not everyone in Cheese Valley eats cheese because they are lactose intolerant, and those people should be taken under consideration, too. One of Ty’s campaign promises is to have “Pizza Fridays”.\xa0 Wanda suggests that it is time for soy cheese to be introduced into Cheese Valley, (“Not Everyone Eats Cheese”.) Ty is impressed with Wanda and tells her so. She is very excited to have befriended the most popular guy in school and dreams of dancing with him at the Halloween party.', 'Mr. Lemmings thinks Wanda’s interview with Ty is superb. He offers Wanda her own show on School Channel 23! Wanda is thrilled.\xa0 She tells him that she dreams of hosting a show where kids could call in and talk about their problems. Ty delivers a speech the day before the election incorporating Wanda’s ideas about respecting people’s differences.\xa0 The student body has never heard of soy cheese! In the Girls Bathroom before the Halloween Dance, Wanda is feeling inadequate and is about to chicken out of going to the dance, but Ms. Dinglederry emerges from one of the stalls in full flamenco costume and encourages her to go. She tells Wanda she just needs a little bit of Spanish in her – (“Diva Latina.”) At the Halloween dance, P.J. spikes the punch and makes Mr. Lemmings and Señorita Dinglederry tipsy. As they tango out of the gym, he tells Wanda that she should ask Ty to dance because Ty is too shy to ask her. When she does, Ty hesitates and P.J. and his cronies move in.\xa0 They heckle him, saying they know he really “like-likes” Blotches, the horrible name P.J. has invented for Wanda. They show everyone incriminating slides of Ty and Wanda (the dark side of photo-shop). They pressure Ty to admit he likes Wanda. Jenny throws him a stricken look.\xa0 Ty caves to peer pressure.\xa0 Wanda flees the dance, humiliated and devastated. Mr. Lemmings sees her running out of the school.\xa0 He follows her and asks what’s wrong. She tells him and says she’s never coming back to the school. Mr. Lemmings reveals that he was the butt of the other kids’ humor when he was Wanda’s age, “Maybe you’ve noticed, I have a slight s-s-stutter.”\xa0 She is desolate that there is no place for her anywhere on the planet.\xa0 (“A Face Like Mine”.)\xa0 He inspires her to have the courage to face her considerable challenge.', 'The next day, P.J. is bragging to Jenny and the other kids.\xa0 He thinks he has the election sewn up because of what he has done to Ty. When Wanda passes by, he gloats over his victory and tries to impress everyone with new insults for Blotches.\xa0 To everybody’s amazement, Wanda stands up for herself. Ty witnesses the scene and sticks up for her, apologizing to her for his behavior the night before. He declares that Wanda is indeed his friend.\xa0 He even renounces Jenny for her cruelty, “From now on, I just want to hang out with people who are nice.”\xa0 He warns P.J. never to bother Wanda again. Everyone rejects P.J. A few weeks later, Wanda’s dream comes true! She is on the air with her very own show – “Wanda’s World” – where she really does take calls from kids with problems and gives them advice borne from her own experience. Newly-elected student council president, Ty Belvedere, is her co-host. Caller Number One has an eating disorder. Wanda knows just what to say. Caller Number Two is scared of a certain bully in school.\xa0 Wanda knows just what to say. Caller Number Three used to be the most popular girl in school but now she has acne!\xa0 She feels sure that nobody will ever like her again.\xa0 All of a sudden, Wanda recognizes the voice—it is Jenny. Wanda knows just what to say, “I’ll come and see you cheer, Jenny! We’ll do a whole story on you!” After all it is Wanda’s World\xa0where every kid has the chance to be heard. Give her a call!']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

When heart-throb chess champ Mike Singer confesses he has a crush on the new quarterback in town, Steve Bookman, Zanna snaps into action and, before you know it, Mike and Steve are scurrying off hand in hand (“I Think We Got Love”).', 'Meanwhile, over at the diner, Roberta is enraged to learn that her girlfriend has been cheating on her, and vehemently puts an end to the relationship (“I Ain’t Got Time”). Zanna once again shifts into high gear, plotting to match Roberta with over-achiever, Kate Aspero. As luck would have it, Kate just happens to be holding auditions for the Girls’ Intramural Mechanical Bull-Riding Team that very afternoon. So with a little dose of Zanna’s magic, Roberta successfully bucks her way into Kate’s heart (“Ride ‘Em”). Exhausted but triumphant after a hard day’s work, Zanna retires for the evening, content that all is right once again in Heartsville (“Zanna’s Song”)… or is it?', 'The next day at Drama Club meeting, the kids decide to put on a musical that addresses the controversial issue of whether or not heterosexuals should be allowed in the military. The play within the play includes “Be a Man”, a musical number that explores Heartsville’s gay only military policy, and “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” an overly dramatic plea for tolerance that is reprised as a poignant ballad in which Kate and Steve secretly start to realize that they—gasp!—have feelings for one another. Kate and Steve try to pretend like nothing has happened, though it is obvious that they are quite shaken up.', 'When Mike proposes moving in with Steve after graduation, Steve gently tries to avoid the issue by asking Mike if maybe they should slow down. Mike reassures Steve that the speed with which two people fall in is a sure sign they were meant for each other, a sentiment echoed by a trio of locals (“Fast”). Scared and confused, Steve rushes out of the I’m OK, You’re OK Corral, leaving Mike perplexed as to Steve’s unpredictable mood swings and behavior (“I Could Write Books”). And to add to the bewilderment, Zanna has the alarming revelation that he himself is also in love…with Steve! Both mystified and frustrated by the inattentiveness of their respective mates, Mike and Roberta playfully fantasize about how much easier life would be if they could be in love (“Don’t You Wish We Could Be in Love?”). Alone in their own worlds, Kate, Steve, and Zanna all join in the song, determined to find a way to bury their feelings.', 'At the State Chess Finals, it is obvious that Kate has been working extra hard to be the perfect girlfriend to Roberta, and Steve has even gone so far as proclaim he is going ask Mike to exchange varsity rings with him after the tournament. To help Mike win the match, Roberta leads the crowd in a raucous chess cheer (“Whatcha Got?”). In the celebratory frenzy of Mike’s victory, Kate and Steve unwittingly end up locked in a deep kiss. The town is thrown into chaos, while Mike, Steve, Kate, and Roberta are left utterly devastated (“Do You Know What It’s Like?”). Later that night, in an effort to prevent the ostracized Kate and Steve from running away from home, Zanna digs through an old book of magic and finds a spell which will make the world safe for heterosexuals. Even though he may lose his magical powers in the process, Zanna decides it is a risk worth taking (“Tis a Far, Far Better Thing I Do/Blow Winds”).', 'When the thunder and smoke from the spell clear, we see Kate and Steve once again locked in a kiss, but this time as King and Queen of the Prom. To celebrate, Tank, the DJ of the school’s student-run radio station, leads everyone in a spirited rendition of the prom theme song (“Straight to Heaven”). Zanna arrives and is shocked to learn that something has gone terribly wrong with the spell; not only has the entire town become heterosexual, but they remember nothing of the previous world. When Zanna tries to correct things, the students tease him for being so different, breaking his wand and ostracizing him.', 'Alone and magic-less, Zanna reflects on the way life used to be (“Someday You Might Love Me”). Unbeknownst to Zanna, the students quietly return to listen to his song, and proceed to apologize for their appalling behavior (“Straight to Heaven” Reprise). As they sing and dance into the distance, they ask Zanna to join them in a post-prom celebration, but Zanna gently declines, preferring to be alone. Just as Zanna is about to go home, Tank rushes in to declare his secret long-standing crush on Zanna (“Sometime, Do You Think We Could Fall in Love?”).

York’s Central Park. This was, of course, long before it was a park, when it was still wilderness and garbage. The family flourished for many generations, and eventually, a huge house was built where a great Spanish oak, the Addams Family Tree, had been planted to protect the ancestral graves from such annoyances as sunlight and tourists. As the curtain rises, the last dead leaf of autumn falls from the Family Tree, and all is right with the morbid, macabre world of Gomez, Morticia, Fester, Grandma, Wednesday, Pugsley and Lurch. They’ve gathered – where else? – in the family graveyard, to celebrate life and death in a yearly ritual to connect with their past and ensure their future. They seem at peace, not just with each other and their inimitable, unchanging Addams-ness, but with their dead ancestors, too – who emerge from their graves on this night each year to join in this celebration of continuity. But, at the end of the ritual, Fester blocks the ancestors’ return to their graves.', 'Those unchanging Addams family values are about to be tested. Fester enlists their help to set things right, just in case a new family secret goes terribly wrong. What’s the secret? Wednesday Addams, that irresistible bundle of malice, has grown up and found love. So what’s the problem? The young man, Lucas Beineke, is from Ohio, and his parents are coming to dinner to meet the family. Two different worlds are about to collide. Will love triumph, or will everyone go home vaguely depressed? Gomez and Morticia are understandably leery. Wednesday is their baby, even if she is eighteen. Their doubts bloom into actual terror when they eavesdrop on Wednesday, who, in the midst of her afternoon play-date with Pugsley, refuses to torture her brother and involuntarily bursts into song – extolling all things bright and beautiful as love pulls her in an entirely new, and cheerful, direction.', 'Like any parents faced with a child in terrible trouble, Gomez and Morticia wonder, “Where did we go wrong?” Wednesday begs her parents not to cancel the dinner, and exhorts the entire family to act as ‘normal’ as possible when Lucas and his parents arrive. She loves her family just the way they are, but they clearly fall outside the realm of what the Middle-American Beinekes are used to, and Wednesday’s afraid that, if his parents don’t approve of her, they’ll take Lucas back to Ohio, and she’ll never see him again. Like any unconditionally loving family, the Addams’ promise to do their best to oblige, while, lost somewhere in Central Park, young Lucas asks his parents to resist any judgments and all catastrophic conflicts, so both families can enjoy one normal night. In yet another part of the house, Pugsley, having witnessed Wednesday and Lucas making out, worries that he’s lost his best friend to her new, disgustingly sunny disposition. Plotting to break up the happy couple, Pugsley steals a volatile potion from Grandma’s private stache – Acrimonium – one swig of which is guaranteed to bring out the dark side in anyone who drinks it.', 'After what is likely a less-than-normal meal, Wednesday quiets the table for Lucas’ surprise announcement. But Gomez reminds Wednesday that, before anything else happens, it’s time for the traditional Addams family game, “Full Disclosure” – during which everyone takes a sip from a sacred chalice and reveals something they’ve never told anyone. Gomez uses his Disclosure to try, again in vain, to calm Morticia. Fester announces that he’s in the throes of a most unlikely love – with the moon. When it’s Wednesday’s turn, Pugsley seizes his chance! He secretly pours the Acrimonium potion in the chalice and passes it to his sister. But his plan to awaken the dark side in Wednesday goes horribly wrong when Alice, coughing, intercepts the chalice and downs the potion instead. A whole new Alice, very dark and uninhibited, is born. The powerful poison prompts her to reveal the long-buried problems with her marriage, humiliating Mal, who, fed up with all the weird and creepy events of the evening, makes to leave, with Alice and Lucas in tow. Wednesday blurts out the news: “Lucas and I are getting married!” Chaos engulfs both families like a tidal wave, and Fester, ever-helpful, urges the Family Ancestors to work some magic – whipping up a sudden, terrible storm and trapping the Beinekes with the Addams family for the night.', 'While the storm rages, Wednesday packs a bag, but Lucas has no appetite for running away and getting married without his parents’ blessing. Wednesday, furious at everything it means to be normal, and furious at herself for trying so hard to become somebody his parents would accept,leaves alone. One more of Gomez’ foot-in-mouth episodes prompts Morticia to throw him out of her boudoir. Her world is changing and she’s not ready, and her only comfort is knowing that death is waiting for her, just around the corner. But it is very cold comfort indeed. In the guest room, Alice, under the influence of the darkness potion, can no longer rhyme. Neither can she tolerate her husband’s cynical attacks on Lucas and love. She packs him off with a pillow and blanket to sleep somewhere else, as the storm inside her heart, and outside in the park, rumbles to a conclusion.', 'Once the rains have stopped, Fester heads outside for a couple of hours of moon-bathing, realizing – after observing the three couples fighting – the sheer luck of being in a long-distance relationship, with the distant silver orb in the sky that smiles down on him from the heavens. Sitting under the family tree, contemplating the twists and turns of this most unusual night,Gomez stops Wednesday on her way out of the park. He realizes the thing he was most resistant to – his baby girl’s growing up – is inevitable, and proper. He sees that she’s a young woman in love. And that makes him happy. And a tiny bit sad. With her father’s blessing, Wednesday offers Lucas one test to prove that he’s The One. The test involves her skills with a crossbow, an apple, and Lucas standing with said apple on his head in front of the family tree. The boy is afraid of death, \xa0but even more afraid of losing Wednesday. He chooses the possibility of death over the certainty of loss – and wins.', 'Far below, in the grotto, Gomez and Mal, two displaced husbands, realize they have more in common than they would have dared imagine only a few hours earlier. While Mal is with Gomez, Lurch ushers Alice down to the grotto. She’s a woman on a mission;\xa0she’s going to lay down the law; changes must be made if the marriage is to\xa0survive. Morticia packs a bag and is ready to leave. But the ancestors’ spirits have led Gomez to find her. The other warring couples, Wednesday and Lucas, Alice and Mal, have\xa0made their peace. Now Gomez woos his wife, as he first did one night many years\xa0before, with the promise to “laugh and cry and dance until the very gods weep\xa0with envy.” The mournful strains of a bandoneon waft up on the breeze, entwining\xa0with the tempting wail of a violin – and a tango begins – the Tango de Amor, the\xa0quintessence of Eros, the dance that makes men weep and women cry out in the\xa0night. The irresistible expression of love between husband and wife. And Morticia\xa0cannot resist.', 'With all three couples reunited, Fester is emboldened to make his move, and\xa0launches himself to the moon. Landing safely, his face appears – the man in the\xa0moon – and, love having emphatically triumphed in heaven and on earth, the gate\xa0to the family crypt swings open, allowing the spirits of the ancestors to rest for\xa0another year. It’s been a night of darkness. Everything’s changed. And the new, extended family\xa0understands: The unknown may be frightening, the darkness overwhelming,but if we don’t run from it, we may see our mysterious, miraculous lives finally\xa0illuminated. If we move toward the darkness, we might find love and acceptance. For when it is dark enough, we can see the stars.', '-Rick Elice Bookwriter for The Addams Family']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

prison (“Jailhouse Rock”). The warden doesn’t appreciate a guy like Chad ridin’ into town, playin’ his music and excitin’ the local women. With a sneer, Chad rides off. In a nearby dreary little town, Natalie, a young mechanic, is dreaming of love and adventure. She yearns for one true love to take her away, but she doesn’t realize that her best friend Dennis has a secret crush on her. Sitting in Sylvia’s, the local honky-tonk, the whole town sings the blues (“Heartbreak Hotel”). Natalie’s widowed father Jim enters and joins in, until they’re interrupted by the roar of a motorcycle: it is Chad, riding into town (“Roustabout”). Chad is in need of a mechanic and he’s introduced to Natalie, who is instantly smitten (“One Night With You”) and promises to fix his bike. Chad asks about any excitement in town, but he’s told that excitement is outlawed under the Mayor’s strict rules: no loud music, no indecent behavior. Chad, incensed, promises to breathe some life into this sad, little town and he touches a broken-down jukebox, and it immediately comes to life (“C’mon Everybody”). As Chad and Natalie go off to fix his bike, Mayor Matilda enters with Earl, the sheriff, and her son, Dean. Matilda scolds the citizens for dancing and singing, and then goes off to find the root of this newfound evil. As soon as she exits, Dean meets Lorraine, Sylvia’s pretty African-American daughter, and the two share a nervous and flirtatious smile. Meanwhile, Natalie is working on Chad’s motorcycle. She tells him of her dreams of the open road, and he tells her that she must follow her heart (“Follow That Dream”). After Chad exits, Natalie, in an attempt to look more girly, puts on the only dress she owns—a tattered old one she uses to clean car engines. Dennis runs into Natalie and he is about to tell her how he feels for her, when Chad enters and interrupts. Ignoring Natalie, Chad asks Dennis to become his sidekick and the overjoyed Dennis accepts. Suddenly, the beautiful and glamorous Sandra appears, and Chad is struck down with a case of hardcore love (“One Night With You”—reprise). Sandra is the owner of the local museum, and she bemoans the lack of culture in this depressing little town. Chad tries to smooth-talk her, but she resists (“Teddy Bear/Hound Dog”). Later that day, at Sylvia’s Honky-Tonk, Jim and Sylvia speak about the strange, lascivious behavior that seems to have befallen the town since Chad’s arrival. Natalie enters in her greasy dress, and Lorraine has her change into one of her dresses—it is clean and cute and Natalie looks lovely. She rushes off in pursuit of Chad. Both Sylvia and Jim agree that at a certain point in life, it’s better to be alone, when Sandra enters and Jim instantly falls for her (“One Night With You”—reprise). Too nervous to speak to such a vision of beauty, he rushes out. Dean enters to tell Lorraine that he thinks she’s beautiful. Lorraine, thrilled, begins to teach him to dance (“That’s All Right”). Sylvia interrupts and insists that it’s NOT all right for them to be together, and Dean rushes out. Dean meets Matilda at the bus stop, and she tells him that she’s sending him back to military school on the next bus. Lorraine enters, and Dean tells her the terrible news—they’re about to be separated. Hopelessly in love, Dean and Lorraine decide to run off together (“It’s Now Or Never”). Both Jim and Chad follow Sandra, but she will have nothing to do with either of them. Dennis meets Natalie on the street and shows off his new hunting cap, which makes him feel like “one of the guys.” Natalie has a sudden inspiration and she grabs Dennis’ hunting cap. Alone in the garage, she dresses like a leather-jacketed male roustabout (“Love Me Tender”). As Chad bemoans Sandra’s lack of attraction to him, Dennis comes up with an idea. He volunteers to take her a Shakespearean sonnet. Desperate, Chad agrees. But before Dennis leaves, a leather-jacked roustabout rides into town (“Blue Suede Shoes”). It is Natalie, dressed as a fellah named Ed. Chad is excited by Ed’s coolness and manliness and he asks Ed to be his new sidekick. Heartbroken, Dennis exits. Chad instructs Ed that his first job as his new sidekick is to give the sonnet to Miss Sandra. Jim enters, and Ed grabs the sonnet and rushes off. Jim tells Chad that he’s in love with a woman who doesn’t love him back. Chad looks over the slovenly Jim, and tells him that in order to win a girl, Jim must dress and act more like Chad. Chad gives Jim a much-needed lesson in coolness (“Don’t Be Cruel”). Ed arrives at the museum and gives Sandra the sonnet. Sandra is so moved by the sonnet that she finds herself drawn to this strange-looking young man (“One Night With You”—reprise). Ed tries to leave, but Sandra is intent on seducing him (“Let Yourself Go”). As the sun goes down, Mayor Matilda is cracking down on the perceived immoral behavior that is now running rampant through the town. She comes upon a necking couple, and she’s stunned to see that it’s her precious Dean kissing Lorraine. Dean, for the first time, disobeys his mother and shows her that he can now dance. He and Lorraine run off into the night. Matilda promises to throw Chad in jail for what he has done, and she and Sheriff Earl drive after Dean. Ed tells Chad that in order to avoid jail, he should hide in the abandoned fairgrounds just outside of town. Chad runs off, and Ed runs off after him. Jim, now dressed like Chad, enters and asks Sylvia if she’s seen Sandra. Sylvia tells Jim that he’s crazy to fall for a woman like that, and Jim admonishes Sylvia for having grown cold and bitter. Jim gives Sylvia a very surprising kiss, and a stunned Sylvia suddenly falls for him. Soon, everyone in town find themselves escaping to the fairgrounds, searching for someone to love (“Can’t Help Falling In Love”).', 'ACT TWO ', 'In the midst of the abandoned fairgrounds, the citizens of the town are restless and randy (“All Shook Up”). Dennis comes upon Natalie, who’s still dressed as Ed, and Dennis reveals that he’s upset about the way Chad treats her (“It Hurts Me”). Natalie insists that Chad is the only guy for her. In an attempt to win Chad, Natalie gets an idea—she convinces Chad to teach her (i.e. Ed) how to seduce a woman (“A Little Less Conversation”) but in the process, Ed winds up kissing Chad. Chad is stunned and Ed runs off as Jim enters. Chad reaffirms his machismo (“Power Of My Love”) when Jim and Chad suddenly realize they are both in love with the same woman. Sandra enters, lustfully looking for Ed. Jim confesses his love for Sandra, but she doesn’t even remember meeting him. As the heartbroken Jim slinks off, Ed enters, and he insists that Sandra leave them alone. Sandra, still hot for Ed, relents and promises to find him later. Left alone, Chad is about to hit Ed, but he realizes that he can’t. Ed gives Chad some “alone time”, and Chad realizes that he has feelings for his new sidekick (“I Don’t Want To”). In another part of the fairgrounds, Mayor Matilda enters, followed, as always, by the silent Sheriff Earl, and she vows to bring the roustabout down (“Devil In Disguise”). A heartbroken Jim wanders about and runs into Sylvia, who is wearing her best Sunday dress. He wonders what she’s doing out there this time of night, and she confesses her newfound feelings for him (“There’s Always Me”). Jim can’t handle this revelation, and he rushes off. In another part of the grounds, Dean and Lorraine plan to catch the morning train out of town, but Chad convinces them to stay and fight for their love (“If I Can Dream”). In the center of the fairgrounds, Matilda gathers the townspeople together to form a pious posse to both find her son and arrest Chad. But Chad enters, as does Dean and Lorraine—and the final confrontation begins… Will true love prevail? (“Fools Fall In Love”) Will the power of music win the day? Will this small town in the Midwest survive getting all shook up? These questions and more are answered as the characters come together for the finale (“Burning Love”).']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

His son Will\xa0(20s) is getting married the next day. Will asks Edward not to tell any of his crazy stories at the wedding. Edward reluctantly agrees. As Will thinks back, he trades places with Young Will\xa0(8). Edward doesn’t want to read his son a bedtime story from a book, but rather tell a story about life (“Be the Hero”), which introduces many characters from Edward’s impossible stories. Edward’s wife Sandra reminds them that it’s time for bed, but Young Will wants to know more about the Witch who showed Edward how he would die (“The Witch”).\u2028\u2028 The story returns to present day. Preparing for the wedding, Edward reveals his suspicion that Will’s fiancée, Josephine, is pregnant. Will confirms the hunch and swears Edward to secrecy. But Edward can’t help himself, revealing the news in a toast to the crowd. In parallel scenes at doctors’ offices, Will and Josephine learn they’re going to have a son, while Edward and Sandra learn that Edward’s cancer has progressed. In New York’s Central Park, Will sings of the wonder and mystery of his future child (“Stranger”), but his joy is interrupted by a phone call from his mother, telling him about Edward’s condition. Will says he’s coming home. \u2028\u2028In the backyard, Sandra tells Will that although he and Edward can be a handful, she loves them both (“Magic in the Man”).', 'Josephine is eager to hear more of Edward’s stories, so he launches into a tale of his high school days (“Ashton’s Favorite Son”), including his small-town girlfriend Jenny Hill and his arch-rival Don Price. Edward journeys to a cave to confront a giant that is frightening the town. But rather than fight Karl the Giant, he befriends him and convinces him to join him on an adventure to see the world.\xa0 (“Out There on the Road”). \u2028\u2028Back in the present, Josephine gets Will to tell her the story of how his parents met, which brings them to the Calloway Circus. Sandra and two friends audition for ringmaster Amos Calloway (“Little Lamb from Alabama”), during which Edward falls in love with her at first sight (“Time Stops”). Amos hires Karl The Giant, while Edward agrees to work for the circus for free in exchange for one monthly clue about Sandra (“Closer to Her”). After three years of toil, Amos (secretly a werewolf) finally reveals that her name is Sandra, she goes to Auburn University, and she loves daffodils. In the present, Josephine discovers a mortgage signed by Edward and Jenny Hill.\xa0 Will wonders why his father would buy a house with a woman other than his mother. Back in Edward’s story, \u2028\u2028Edward travels to Auburn, only to discover that Sandra is engaged to be married to Don Price from Ashton. Don beats up Edward, but that convinces Sandra to break up with Don. Edward promises to love Sandra forever (“Daffodils”). They kiss.', 'Act II', 'Reeling from the discovery of the mortgage, Will wonders if his dad had a second life. A second family. Later, Edward tells Sandra and Young Will he’ll be traveling more for work. Edward tells Young Will he’ll be the man of the house. He needs to be brave and “Fight the Dragons.” \u2028\u2028In the present, Will attempts to ask his father about the mortgage, but Edward keeps derailing the conversation with jokes and talk of wooly mammoths. When Will brings up Ashton, Edward grows angry and they confront each other (“The River Between Us”). Calmed down by Sandra, Edward falls into an uneasy sleep and wakes up yelling and confused in the middle of a thunderstorm. Sandra comforts him, telling him “I Don’t Need a Roof” to feel at home. She only needs Edward. \u2028\u2028Will travels to Ashton, where he meets Jenny Hill. She tells him the story of what happened when Edward returned to Ashton. The valley is about to be flooded by a new reservoir, yet the townsfolk refuse to leave, chaining themselves to a statue in protest. Edward convinces them to build a new Ashton (“Start Over”). He gets land from Amos and money from Karl, both of whom have become successful because of Edward. Only Jenny Hill refuses to leave. She’d been waiting in Ashton all these years for Edward to return. To save her life, Edward reconnects with her, and co-signs the mortgage on a new house. They kiss — but Edward breaks it off. From the moment he saw her until the moment he dies, Sandra is the only woman he’ll love. As Jenny Hill finishes the story, Will gets a phone call. Edward’s condition has worsened.', 'Alone in the hospital with the unconscious Edward, Will tells him that he went to Ashton, and that he now understands the reason for his stories. Edward stirs, in pain, and asks Will to tell him how he dies. Will has to make up the story on the spot (“What’s Next”) of how Edward escapes the hospital and travels to the river, where everyone from his stories is waiting for him. At the river, Edward sings about his life and what it meant (“How it Ends”). Back in reality, Edward dies in the hospital bed.\u2028\u2028 The funeral takes place at the river’s edge. As the guests shake Will’s hand, he sees that each is the real-world equivalent of the characters from Edward’s stories. A few years later, Will teaches his own son to fish, and the secret his father taught him (“Be the Hero” reprise).']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

for all the coming frustrations, freak-outs, and fears, singing “Ready or Not.” The action moves to Playa Sola High School where we meet the popular slacker/surfer Kyle Fairbanks.\xa0 The upcoming prom “Magical Night” is on everybody’s minds, and Kyle’s gorgeous yet snobby girlfriend and her cadre of fashionistas lay down the rules about just how they expect to be asked to prom in “Do It Right.” In english class, Natalie is asked to present her oral book report.\xa0 Of course, overachiever Natalie can’t summarize just one book and shares three biographies of feminist pioneers singing “Makin’ It” (in a man’s world).\xa0 Afterwards, Ms. O’Brien almost nails Kyle for not being prepared, when the bell rings.\xa0 Brad, Kyle’s friend, asks him if he’s ready (and reminds him his dad said, “No prom,” if he’s failing.)\xa0 Despite Brad’s urgent warning, Kyle tells him to relax as he looks across the classroom at Natalie.\xa0 “Would you relax, man,” he says, “I’m on it.”', 'Later in the high school common area, computer geek Freddy asks Shelly to the prom.\xa0 As much as she’d like to go with him, she turns him down – going to prom with Freddy would never be cool enough for her to hang with Ashley and her posse.\xa0 In a pretty sleazy attempt to get Natalie to do his book report, Kyle comes on to Natalie, singing “Get a Life,” but Natalie sees right through him.\xa0 After Kyle leaves, Natalie’s best friend Claire ask her about the encounter, but Natalie dismisses the whole thing, telling Claire, “you know what they call the girls who’s greatest achievement in high school is being popular – the real housewives of Orange County.”\xa0 Natalie’s phone rings, and she finds out from her mom that she’s a finalist in the Edna Quinn Bellows Public Speaking, College Scholarship Contest.', 'The next day, on a school field trip to a historic mission – The Mission of Weeping Maiden – Garrett, an enthusiastic storyteller with an interest in all things otherworldly, asks about the mission’s name.\xa0 Chloe, their guide, tells him about a Native American maiden, who threw herself in the mission’s well they now stand before, when her love for a young Spanish nobleman was forbidden, “after which, half the town totally died of dysentery,” she tells them.\xa0 Garrett then whips the kids into a frenzy, singing “Supernatural.”\xa0 After the kids disperse, Kyle and Natalie find themselves at the well together.\xa0 In an angry confrontation, they begin throwing coins in the well, wishing curses at each other.\xa0 “I wish that someday Kyle Fairbanks finds out what a jerk he is,” Natalie says.\xa0 “And I wish that Natalie Watson realizes how boring life is when all you do is homework!” Kyle says back at her.\xa0 There is a clap of thunder, the lights dim, and in the darkness, accompanied by mystical music, Kyle and Natalie’s brains mysteriously switch places into each other’s bodies.', 'The next morning, Kyle (Natalie) and Natalie (Kyle) [from this point in the synopsis, the name of the mind of the character is in parentheses] realize their brains are in one another’s bodies and sing, “Back Where I Belong.”\xa0 They both rush to school, Kyle (Natalie) now dressed in a shirt and tie (because that’s how Natalie dressed him) and Natalie (Kyle) in a slinky cocktail dress (because Kyle’s done the same), and they realize they’re stuck this way until they can get back to the mission, which doesn’t open until ten.\xa0 Natalie (Kyle) asks Kyle (Natalie) for a favor.\xa0 “Can you hook my bra for me?” she asks.\xa0 “What?!” Kyle (Natalie) asks.\xa0 “I’ve been tryin’ to get this stupid thing hooked for the last half hour.”\xa0 Of course, the minute he does, Brittany, one of Ashley’s posse walks past and sees the whole thing. In “Texting Song,” word spreads like wildfire as everyone eventually finds out “there’s something goin’ on between those two.”\xa0 As Brad and Claire try to sort out their best friends’ bizarre behavior, they become friends.\xa0 When they overhear Kyle (Natalie) and Natalie (Kyle) planning a trip back to the mission, they follow them.\xa0 At the well, Mr. Molina, the caretaker, scolds Kyle (Natalie) and Natalie (Kyle) for treating the mission like a “chamber of horrors.”\xa0 Natalie (Kyle) remembers he’s got a date with Ashley to ask her to the prom, and Kyle (Natalie) agrees to help him out with it.', 'After they leave, Brad and Claire try to make sense of what they’ve seen.\xa0 As they ponder the possibilities of a wishing well, they begin to share their own desires and secrets, singing “Wishes.”\xa0 Afterwards, Brad asks Claire to the prom.\xa0 She accepts. That night, Kyle (Natalie) takes Ashley on the perfect date – a romantic dinner on the beach, complete with appetizers, poetry and napkin holders. Kyle (Natalie) then sees an eclipse is beginning and realizes she’s got to get back to the well. At the well, Kyle (Natalie) and Natalie (Kyle) attempt to reverse the spell by writing their wishes on papers and dropping them in.\xa0 When the attempt fails, they check to see if the eclipse has reached totality.\xa0 Kyle (Natalie) lifts Natalie (Kyle) up on the wall to look over the trees, and as he steadies her, Ashley walks in, convinced Kyle’s two-timing her.\xa0 Natalie (Kyle) begs Kyle (Natalie) to tell Ashley that he could never be interested in someone as “ordinary” as Natalie, and follows her off.', 'Alone, Kyle (Natalie) realizes the price she’s paid to stay true to herself and her goals, singing “Being Me.”\xa0 Natalie (Kyle) returns and realizes how much what he’s said has hurt her.\xa0 He tries to apologize, but both furious and hurt, Kyle (Natalie) leaves.\xa0 The act ends with Natalie (Kyle) vowing to get things right as she sings a reprise of “Back Where I Belong.”', 'Act II', 'The act opens with Garrett, still trying to get to the bottom of all this weirdness, leading the rest of the cast in singing “What Comes Next.”\xa0 Then Natalie (Kyle) asks Kyle (Natalie) how he’s going to patch thing up with Ashley.\xa0 Kyle (Natalie) tells Natalie (Kyle) not to worry, he’s got it all worked out.\xa0 As Natalie (Kyle) listens in, Kyle (Natalie) smoothes thing over, giving Ashley an Amazonian Orchid.\xa0 Then, after Kyle (Natalie) leaves, it becomes clear that Ashley still feels her position as the hottest girl in the school is threatened singing, “Suspicious.”\xa0 Ashley sees Natalie (Kyle) making her exit and tells her that if she ever thought Kyle was really interested in Natalie, she’d drop him “so fast he have to be treated for whiplash.”\xa0 The conversation begins to give Kyle a clearer picture of Ashley’s coldness.\xa0 After they leave, Brad and Claire discover Kyle’s to-do list.\xa0 When they read Kyle’s (Natalie’s) first task is to “decontaminate Kyle’s sock drawer,” they begin to realize their friends just may have switched brains.', 'When Kyle (Natalie) and Natalie (Kyle) get together to rehearse Natalie’s speech for the scholarship competition, things suddenly start to change.\xa0 Instead of irritating each other, a mutual (and slightly terrifying) attraction begins to develop in “Being With You.” Shelly unexpectedly shows up at the computer lab, looking for Freddy.\xa0 She tells him she was stupid not to say yes when he asked.\xa0 They make it a date, and let each other know how they really feel singing “Download My Love.” At the Edna Quinn Bellows College Scholarship Speech Competition, Natalie (Kyle) has a flash of inspiration in the middle of Natalie’s speech, and compares Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton to world-record-holding surfer Mike Parsons.\xa0 After the speech, Kyle (Natalie) is furious when Skeeter Quinn Bellows, a surfing fanatic and Edna’s nephew, gives Natalie (Kyle) the award.\xa0 However, Kyle (Natalie) can’t accept the award, since it wasn’t her speech that won the prize.\xa0 Natalie (Kyle) begins to realize how he never really appreciated Natalie and romance blossoms as they sing “Gonna Stay With Me.”\xa0 Ashley suddenly arrives, furious at the obvious attraction between them.\xa0 At Natalie’s (Kyle’s) direction, Kyle (Natalie) breaks up with Ashley.\xa0 Then Natalie (Kyle) asks Kyle (Natalie) to the prom.\xa0 When she balks at the idea, Natalie (Kyle) tells her, “Okay, look at it this way.\xa0 If I’m going to go to the prom with some guy, it’s gonna be me.”', 'In “Magical Night,” the cast arrives at the dance, where Ashley plots her revenge, planning to put a mysterious something in Kyle’s drink.\xa0 Word gets out what she’s planning, and through the course of the dance, Ashley’s spiked drink circulates among the cast.\xa0 As they sing, “…never gonna be another night as magical as this,” no one’s quite sure just who’s drinking what. Then Garrett happens to tell Brad and Claire what he’s learned about the myth of the well – the poem on the plaque there can be translated to read, “…then comes the changing minds.”\xa0 They tell Natalie (Kyle) and Kyle (Natalie) and everyone rushes to the mission’s well where they once again try to get their own minds back.\xa0 As they arrive there, Mr. Molina explains to them that an expression of genuine caring might convince the spirits to undo their magic.\xa0 Kyle (Natalie) and Natalie (Kyle) kiss, and magically, the spell is broken.\xa0 Ashley arrives, her hair now turned bright red, having literally taken her own medicine, and all ends happily for the rest of the cast as they sing, “Ready, Next, Go.”', '\xa0']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

He is instantly smitten with ingénue Niki Harris. The undisputed central character of the musical. Requires deft and charming comedy, good singing, solid dancing in one extended “Fred and Ginger” number.', 'NIKI HARRIS (20’s-early 30’s)\xa0 Pretty, almost too innocent ingénue, a local performer in a small role hoping “Robbin’ Hood” will be the Boston production that at last takes her to Broadway. Love interest for Lieutenant Cioffi, apparently reciprocated.\xa0 Requires a legit soprano and strong dancing in an extended “Fred and Ginger” number.', 'GEORGIA HENDRICKS (30’s – mid-40’s, similar age to AARON) Female half of our show-within-a-show’s songwriting team on the lyric-writing side. Ends up taking on the leading lady role. Must sing and dance extremely well.', 'CARMEN BERNSTEIN (45-65) Brash and brassy Broadway producer. Terrific comedic actress with a belt.', 'AARON FOX (30’s – 40’s, similar age to GEORGIA) The composer of the show-within-the-show. His songwriting partner, Georgia, is also his wife, from whom he’s separated but for whom he still pines.\xa0 He’s a handsome, intense, somewhat tortured artist-type. Requires a strong vocalist with comedy.', 'SIDNEY BERNSTEIN (Late 50’s-Mid 60’s): The always-angry, sleazy, philandering producer of the out-of-town flop. Sidney is rough around the edges and completely self-serving. Requires a cartoon-like character actor who is funny on arrival. No singing required.', 'CHRISTOPHER BELLING (40-60) English director. Very camp. Very droll. Noel Coward meets Addison DeWitt meets Clifton Webb. Requires a superb comic actor.', 'BAMBI BERNÉT (Early 20’s-early 30’s) Performer in the chorus, daughter of Carmen, step-daughter of Sidney. Genuinely brassy and artificially blonde. Hungry to work her way out of the chorus; many think she was only hired because of her mother. She surprises everyone, however, when she shows genuine dancing and singing talent when at last called upon. Requires great dancing, strong “street-smart dumb blonde” comedy, and singing.', 'OSCAR SHAPIRO (45-65): from the garment district and sole investor in “Robbin’ Hood.” A likeably gruff man who knows nothing about theatre and frets over every dime of his that’s spent. Requires good “rough around the edges” comedy and singing.', 'BOBBY PEPPER (30’s to early 40’s, similar age as Georgia and Aaron) The Gene Kelly of “Robbin’ Hood,” its choreographer and male star, and a handsome rival to Aaron for Georgia’s affection. Requires strong dancing, singing, comedy.', 'DARYL GRADY (30’s-40’s): Caustic and smug theatre critic for the local Boston newspaper. Patronizingly pompous, enjoys using his power to make or break shows during their Boston tryouts. Does not require strong singing or dancing.', 'JOHNNY HARMON * (30’s-60’s) Stage Manager of the show-within-the-show, and both drill sergeant and mother hen to the cast. Barks orders but has a pleasant side as well, he keeps the company in line and on their toes throughout the rehearsal process. Comic actor who can sing.', 'JESSICA CRANSHAW (40’s-60’s) Faded Hollywood star, a grand diva with no right to be one, and a plague to the show-with-the-show and to her cast. An absolutely dreadful singer and inept actress who stars in the show-within-a-show and gets murdered on its opening night in Boston. Must be skillful enough to sing hilariously out-of-tune and ineptly, and adroit enough to dance perfectly out of step with the rest of the cast. Appears only in the first minutes of the musical; on Broadway, this performer then adopted a different look and became part of the ensemble.', 'RANDY DEXTER (20’s – 30’s) a member of the singing & dancing ensemble featured in “Kansasland,” pleasant but with a sensitive side.', 'HARV FREMONT (20’s – 30’s) a member of the singing & dancing ensemble who bears a bouquet. ROBERTA WOOSTER (20’s – 30’s) a member of the singing & dancing ensemble who speaks from experience.', 'ENSEMBLE *Note:\xa0 the role of JOHNNY HARMON can be played by a woman using the name JENNY HARMON, with all the same character traits as described. It is not recommended that any other roles described above be played by the opposite gender, as it would be contrary to the dynamics of the mystery, the comedy, and the period.']",https://www.theatricalrights.com/apply-for-a-license/?select-show=curtains-school-edition,"

As the valiant cast proclaims their undying affection for the Wide Open Spaces of Kansas, a sour note is sounded by the voice of faded film star Jessica Cranshaw, who can’t act, can’t sing, and can’t dance — not even a little. Jessica’s name may be above the title, but her performance has been beneath contempt, both on-stage and off. She takes her mandatory bow in front of the cowboy-costumed company, gathers up her obligatory bouquets from a pair of tuxedoed ushers, and collapses in a heap, easily the most graceful move she’s made all evening. The cast rushes to their fallen star behind the fallen curtain and bear the unbearable Jessica off to Boston Hospital.', 'A few hours later, on the now darkened Colonial stage, four tormented souls in evening dress search the night owl editions of the Boston morning papers for a single charitable review. The show’s composer, Aaron Fox and lyricist Georgia Hendricks — recently divorced but professionally reunited in an attempt to create musical magic where their marriage has otherwise gone flat — find nary a quote to pull. Equally empty-handed is the show’s lone financial backer Oscar Shapiro, garment district maven but theatre district novitiate. Slightly less daunted is Carmen Bernstein, co-producer (with her husband Sidney) of Robbin’ Hood! The four speculate about “What Kind of Man”, woman, or beast would ever choose to be a critic. They are joined by feverishly fey director, Christopher Belling, who announces he’s just given birth to a brainchild the producers must instantly adopt. To demonstrate his plan, he asks Georgia to sing Jessica Cranshaw’s first ballad in the show. It’s no secret to the company that Georgia has recently rekindled a past romance with leading man Bobby Pepper. Though her ex-husband may be accompanying her at the piano, Georgia is clearly thinking of Bobby as she sings “Thinking of Him”. Director Belling reveals his masterful plan: as long as Jessica Cranshaw is indisposed, her part should be filled by Georgia, a former stage performer who obviously knows the show inside and out because she is its co-creator. All approve, except ex-husband Aaron, who points out that the issue is academic if Jessica Cranshaw returns to work. But the fateful news arrives: “The Woman’s Dead”.', 'An impromptu funeral ceremony in Jessica’s honor is interrupted by the arrival of Homicide Lieutenant Frank Cioffi, who saw Robbin’ Hood! in previews and thinks that, with the exception of the late Miss Cranshaw, the cast are all spectacular performers in one heck of a show. The Lieutenant has done some amateur theatrical work himself, and he is as shocked as Carmen Bernstein to learn that the cast does not feel the show must go on. He and Carmen must remind the company that they are part of a special breed known as “Show People”. With their faith in themselves and Robbin’ Hood! renewed, the cast prepares to leave for the night when Cioffi explains that they can’t. Since an autopsy has revealed that Jessica Cranshaw swallowed poison pellets in the last minutes of the show, during which time she never left the stage, it’s clear she was murdered by a member of the company. Cioffi feels the surest way to solve the crime will be to keep the entire cast of suspicious characters sequestered in the theatre. Sidney Bernstein, the show’s senior producing partner (and Carmen’s philandering lesser half) arrives from New York — or at least that’s where he claims to have been at the time of the murder. Cioffi is left alone with local neophyte actress Niki Harris, who understudied Jessica Cranshaw but is now covering for Georgia. The police detective is clearly smitten with Niki’s winsome charm and confides in her about his investigation. They learn that they are both married … to their respective careers, which in Cioffi’s case has resulted in a life of lunch counter mornings and “Coffee Shop Nights”.', 'The next day, as Georgia struggles to regain her show biz sea legs, Carmen and Sidney Bernstein invite Boston Globe senior drama critic Daryl Grady to pay them a visit, much to his bewilderment, since his review of the show found precious little to praise. The producers ask Grady to re-review their musical with its new lead, but the best he can offer is to appraise the next evening’s re-opening. With Grady’s challenge accepted, Chris Belling prepares to restage a particularly troublesome number, entitled “In the Same Boat”. Cioffi is startled to hear himself suggest that the problem might lie in the song itself, and the director is surprised to hear himself agree. Composer Aaron Fox is urged to concoct a different number for the same slot in the show, minus the assistance of his ex-wife who, owing to her frantic rehearsal schedule, has now become his ex-writing partner as well. In private with Lieutenant Cioffi, the composer makes a most unexpected confession. (“I Miss the Music”) Any doubt that Georgia could hold the stage is happily dispelled by the dress rehearsal of the big saloon hall number “Thataway!” But as the Act One curtain descends, murder rises to the occasion, and a key member of the company is forced to face The Big Blackout.', 'Act II', 'The second act begins with the updated medical status of the most recent victim: “The Man is Dead”. Curtains rise upon a makeshift dormitory on the Colonial’s stage, as things go bump in the night and the company, in varying stages of dress and undress, point fingers of suspicion at each other, puzzling over whether She or “He Did It”. Cioffi arrives with a grim report from the coroner and even graver concerns about the show’s rapidly-approaching deadline. Aaron previews his best effort at “In the Same Boat #2” but the zealous Cioffi sends it back to the drawing board once again, while urging that star Bobby Pepper be added to the Fort Henderson square dance. This prompts Bambi, an aspiring chorine and also Carmen’s daughter, to plead for a pas de deux (“for two”) for herself and Bobby, as a spotlight moment in the number. Carmen reluctantly gives Bambi her chance, although she reminds her that a hard-nosed producer watches the box office, not the stage, and in commercial theatre, the bottom line is: “It’s a Business”. Much to Carmen’s surprise, Bambi shines in the rehearsal of the restaged Kansasland. But even as Bambi gets her big shot, Bobby Pepper gets his, from a gun offstage. Or was someone else the target? Cioffi’s craft as a detective takes center stage as he traces the bullet’s torturous path. He is also able to solve the mystery of why Aaron Fox and Georgia Hendricks were so anxious to work on Robbin’ Hood! as the former husband and wife team discover ample reason to renew their vows. (“Thinking of Him/I Miss the Music Reprise”).', 'With the spotlight suddenly on romance, Cioffi’s magnifying glass focuses on the ingénue who’s too-good-to-be-true. In his wildest dreams, instead of tracking footprints, he’d be trading steps with Niki up a theatrical stairway, making moves that even Fred and Ginger would find “A Tough Act to Follow”. But in the realm of homicide, the blink of an eye can turn daydream into nightmare, as Cioffi realizes that Niki is carrying a secret, one she has shared with stage manager Johnny Harmon. Johnny’s lips remain sealed — and the killer hopes to keep them that way forever. Cioffi’s investigation takes him high above the stage and, hearing the chorus below as they rehearse “In the Same Boat #3”, he hits upon a solution to some (if not all) the production’s problems, in a melodic amalgam that finally sees “In the Same Boat Completed”. With that immense puzzle solved to the company’s satisfaction, Cioffi has merely to piece together the clues he’s gathered, correctly unmask the killer, save the life of the murderer’s next intended victim, render the fiend harmless, make sense of a troubling but telltale observation, and find a new finale for the show. In doing so, Carmen Bernstein gives Cioffi the highest praise he could ever hope to receive: he is truly one of those “Show People” who understands why the show must go on. The revamped “Wide Open Spaces Finale” may be “A Tough Act to Follow (reprise)”, but for Lieutenant Frank Cioffi, the curtain is just about to rise on the greatest joy of his life.']","{'sets': ['Music Theatre of Wichita', 'Ja’Duke Theatre Inc.'], 'costumes': ['Syracuse Talent Company Christine Lightcap 315-637-3733 chrislightcap@aol.com', 'Broadway Costumes 1100 West Cermak Road · Second Floor Chicago · Illinois · 60608 · USA 800-397-3316', 'Costume Holiday House, 3038 Hayes Avenue, Fremont OH 43420, 419-334-3236', 'For specific questions\xa0please feel free to contact us at:\xa0theatre@costumeholidayhouse.com.'], 'props': ['Prop Rentals NY', 'Featuring Must Haves & Additional Choices', 'Phone: (516) 459-0106', 'John@proprentalsny.com']}"

Their history together is full of happy memories, vacations, photographs and now a newly shared apartment in Brooklyn – they can’t afford Manhattan! Sam is a high-powered banker who has control of numerous accounts and millions and millions of dollars. He works with Carl Bruner, a good friend who comes round to the apartment and shares take-aways and beers with Sam and Molly. Molly is an artist, often working from home, hence the need for the large loft apartment. Perhaps the only downside to their idyllic existence is Sam’s inability to tell Molly that he loves her, only ever using the word “ditto.” Out together one night, Sam and Molly are set upon by a mugger, intent on stealing Sam’s wallet. Sam offers him money, but this is not enough for the mugger, Willie Lopez, who is fixated with the wallet, which we later learn contains the passwords to the accounts which Sam has control of. In the struggle that ensues, a shot rings out. As Sam staggers away from Willie, he notices that Molly is crouched desperately over a body. His body. Sam’s body is taken to hospital, where he dies on the operating table. Sam’s ghost is stuck between worlds, confused and alone, until he is befriended by a friendly ghost who explains about his current situation. Sam begins to learn how the spirit world works, but he cannot do the one thing that he needs to do, which is communicate with Molly. Sam finds himself at the parlour of Oda Mae Brown, a dodgy psychic who specialises in conning money out of vulnerable widows. He realises that Oda Mae can hear him and he persuades her to visit Molly. Initially cynical, Molly begins to believe Oda Mae when she tells her private things about her life with Sam. However, in the background, Carl is determined that Molly should not believe Oda Mae. Sam follows Carl to the flat of Willie Lopez, believing that he is going to confront him, only to discover that the mugging was at Carl’s instigation, with the purpose of obtaining the passwords and transferring money from Sam’s accounts to his.', 'Molly finds it harder and harder to cope with Sam’s loss and, despite Carl’s best efforts to help her to forget her fiance, Molly sinks further into her grief. Meanwhile, Sam is working to thwart Carl’s plan. With the help of a ghost on the subway, he learns how to move objects with the power of his mind, before beginning to haunt Carl, typing the word “murderer” onto his computer screen. Of course, Carl does not see Sam, so is traumatised by this turn of events. Sam persuades Oda Mae to help him once more, this time to become a fictitious account customer, the owner of an account that Carl has created as part of his scam. As “Rita Miller”, Oda Mae enters the bank and makes a withdrawal, with Sam giving her pointers to stop her real identity being revealed. Oda Mae can’t believe her ears when she is told that she is about to withdraw $10 million and leaves, somewhat unsteadily, with a bankers cheque made out to this amount. Oda Mae considers what she is going to do with her newfound wealth, but Sam makes her give the money away. They return to Molly, just in time before Carl arrives, desperate for the cheque that “Rita Miller” has withdrawn. In the struggle the ensues, Carl dies and is consumed by the shadows of death. Sam and Molly realise that is time for them to say goodbye for the last time. Sam thanks Oda Mae and, for the first time, is able to tell Molly that he loves her, before ascending up into the light of happiness and eternal life.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

(“Alma Mater Parody”). Sandy Dumbrowski, the new girl at school and Danny Zuko, the leader of the ‘Burger Palace Boys’, had a brief romantic fling over the summer. Sandy recounts her version of the fling to the ‘Pink Ladies’ (Jan, Marty, Frenchy, and Betty Rizzo), while Danny tells the Boys (Roger, Doody, Sonny, and Kenickie) his rendition (“Summer Nights”). Sandy and Danny soon bump into each other at school, and while Sandy is happy to see him, he plays it cool. Meanwhile, the kids gather in the hall as Doody shows off his new guitar. The rock star wannabe gives an impromptu concert in the hall (“Those Magic Changes”). At Marty’s pajama party, the girls give each other pierced ears, and talk about boys. Marty tells about her long-distance courtship with Freddy (“Freddy, My Love”). Meanwhile, the Burger Palace Boys are busy stealing hubcaps and teasing Kenickie about his new (used) car (“Greased Lightning”). Danny sees Sandy again and tries to apologize for his behavior. Head cheerleader Patty Simcox interrupts to prompt Sandy to join the squad and to tease Danny about his latest indiscretions (“Rydell Fight Song”). The kids take their newfangled portable radios for a rock and roll picnic in the park and plan how they will pair off at the upcoming school prom, while Roger shares his love for Jan and his favorite hobby (“Mooning”). Rizzo teases Danny for falling for a girl who resembles the excessively proper teenage ingénue, Sandra Dee (“Look at Me, I’m Sandra Dee”). Sandy realizes that Danny is putting her off to be cool and wishes she had never met him. Then Danny suggests that Marty go out with Eugene, and she chases after him. Act I ends with a spirited pledge of friendship (“We Go Together”).', 'Act II ', 'At the High School Hop, everyone is dancing, except Sandy (“Shakin’ At the High School Hop”). She is home feeling sorry for herself (“It’s Raining on Prom Night”). Meanwhile, favorite radio DJ Vince Fontaine, is warming the kids up for the hand-jive dance contest. Kenickie dumps his blind date, Cha-Cha DiGregorio, and pairs up with Rizzo. Danny and Cha-Cha then proceed to win the dance contest (“Born to Hand Jive”). A few days later at the Burger Palace after school, a couple of the guys run into Frenchy, who flunked out of Rydell and has now dropped out of beauty school (“Beauty School Dropout”). Danny, who has taken up track in order to win back Sandy’s affections, does not know that Cha-Cha’s boyfriend’s gang has challenged the guys to a rumble. He is more concerned about patching things up with Sandy at the Twi-Light Drive-In, but he moves too fast for her, and she leaves (“All Alone at a Drive-In Movie”). A couple of days later, the “greasers” are having a party in Jan’s basement, as Doody and Roger sing “Rock ‘n’ Roll Party Queen.” Sandy wonders what she needs to do to fit in at Rydell (“Look at Me, I’m Sandra Dee Reprise”). The next time Sandy meets up with the Burger Palace Boys and the Pink Ladies, she has transformed herself into a greaser’s dream date (“All Choked Up”). Rizzo and Kenickie reunite. All ends happily (“We Go Together-Reprise”).']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Huey Calhoun, a white man, arrives on the scene. The regulars begin to leave, but Huey convinces them to stay, claiming he is there for the music (“The Music of My Soul”). Later, Huey is about to be fired from his job as a stock boy at a local department store, but he makes a deal with the owner – if he can sell 5 records by playing them over the speakers, he can have a sales job. Huey plays a Rock and Roll hit (“Scratch My Itch”). He sells 29 records in a matter of minutes, but the store owner fires him anyway, incensed at the type of music being played.', 'Huey returns to Delray’s club, and begins flirting with Felicia, Delray’s talented sister, and promises to get her on the radio (“Ain’t Nothin’ But a Kiss”). Huey then proceeds to apply for DJ jobs at various local white radio stations. One of the owners, Mr. Simmons, invites him in, saying he’ll show him what a ‘real’ DJ looks like. Huey hijacks the mic, and plays another African-American rock song (“Everybody Wants to be Black on Saturday Night”). Mr. Simmons is about to have Huey thrown out, but then dozens of teenagers start calling in demanding more of Huey and his music. Mr. Simmons agrees to give him a two week trial, and if he’s successful he’ll get hired full time. After a few days Huey is told to read an advertisement for beer, but he is illiterate. Huey asks Bobby, a friend of Delray’s with a janitor position, to tell him what it says. He forgets the exact words almost immediately and begins to improvise, ending with the phrase “Hockadoo!”. Mr. Simmons again almost fires Huey, until the manager of the store advertised calls in saying that he wants Huey to do all of his advertisements, seeing as his stock sold out in minutes.', 'Huey’s station gains immediate popularity, as does his new catch phrase, even though no one understands what it means – including Huey. While on the radio, Huey encourages white people to go down to black churches (“Make Me Stronger”), and they begin to. Meanwhile, Delray has saved enough money to put Felicia’s voice on the record, and she travels to Huey’s house to tell him this. He is overjoyed and promises to play it the next day. Huey’s prejudiced mother, however, breaks the record, which leaves Felicia heartbroken, but Huey tells her to come down to the radio station anyway (“Colored Women”). The next day, Huey brings in a band and back-up singers to play for Felicia live. Despite her reservations, Felicia sings and becomes an instant sensation (“Someday”). Felicia and Huey’s relationship begins to grow, and Delray is becoming more and more infuriated with Huey. He warns him of the danger of what he is doing, threatening to harm Huey if anything happens to Felicia (“She’s My Sister”).', 'Huey’s radio popularity grows more and more as white teens and black teens begin to accept each other (“Radio”). Huey and Felicia have been carrying on a secret relationship since the day she sang live on the radio. Two years later Huey proposes to Felicia on the way to a party at Delray’s. She says no because of laws and prejudice, but admits that without those obstacles she would accept. As the two share a kiss, a gang of white men pass by, spotting this. They hold Huey down as they beat Felicia with a bat. Huey manages to carry her into the club, crying out for help. Delray tries to go after Huey, for he promised to harm Huey should Felicia get hurt because of him, but Gator, a friend who has not spoken since he saw his father lynched as a child, calms him and sends out a prayer for change as Delray takes Felicia outside and gets her into the ambulance they called (“Say a Prayer”).', 'Act 2', 'Time has passed, and Huey is about to open his new TV show, a rock and roll variety show featuring all African American dancers (“Crazy Little Huey”). Felicia is supposed to be his first guest, but she backs out at the last minute, fearing that people will think her and Huey to be in a relationship. Huey informs Bobby that he will fill in, and after getting over some jitters, Bobby brings the house down (“Big Love”). Felicia’s popularity is also beginning to grow around Memphis, as does her relationship with Huey. Felicia tells Huey that if they went to New York they wouldn’t have to sneak around all the time, but Huey insists that they are happy the way they are and don’t need to leave (“Love Will Stand When All Else Falls”). She has been discovered by a talent agency in New York, as has Huey’s TV show. The agency wants them both to come up to New York, although Huey has to compete with a local Philadelphia DJ, Dick Clark for the national show. They ponder the decision (“Stand Up”), and are even supported by Huey’s mother, who has changed her racist ways after seeing an African American church choir (“Change Don’t Come Easy”).', 'Huey is told he has won the TV position, if he agrees not to use African American dancers. Huey refuses, and proceeds to strip out of his suit on the air (“Tear Down the House”). Felicia tells Huey that she plans to go anyway, as it is her dream. In a desperate attempt to keep her, he kisses her on the air, and says he loves her (“Love Will Stand/Ain’t Nothin’ But a Kiss” (Reprise)). The feed is cut, and Huey is fired on the grounds that no one would watch his show if they knew about him and Felicia, and that he wasn’t the only white person to play black music anymore.', 'Felicia is taken away by Delray in an attempt to save her career. Now unemployed, Huey leaves the station and ponders his relationship with Memphis, realizing he couldn’t leave for any reason (“Memphis Lives in Me”). Four years later, Huey is a DJ on an obviously low budget and low rated station (he jokes that they have “exactly one listener”). Felicia walks in, about to start a national tour. She tells Huey that she is engaged to a man named Bill, but that she wants him to join her on stage one last time. He refuses, afraid that no one will remember him. She begins her performance, and halfway through the song Huey walks on stage, and finishes the song with her to thunderous applause. He then proclaims “The name is Huey Calhoun. Goodnight and HOCKADOO!” (“Steal Your Rock and Roll”).']","{'sets': ['NETworks Productions – National Tour Sets/Costumes', 'Prop Rentals NY', 'Memphis Props', 'Phone: (516) 459-0106', 'John@proprentalsny.com'], 'costumes': ['Broadway Costumes\xa01100 West Cermak Road · Second Floor Chicago · Illinois · 60608 · USA 800-397-3316'], 'props': []}"

I', 'The play begins with a historian giving a brief overview of medieval England. An idyllic Scandinavian village appears, with gaily dressed Finnish villagers singing and dancing to the “Fisch Schlapping Song.” The Historian returns, irritated, and tells them he said “England”, not Finland. The villagers disperse and the pastoral forest is immediately replaced by a dreary, dark village with penitent monks in hooded robes chanting Latin prayers and hitting themselves in the face with wooden boards. King Arthur travels the land with his servant Patsy (“King Arthur’s Song”), trying to recruit Knights of the Round Table to join him in Camelot and his quest for the Holy Grail. He encounters various strange people, including a pair of sentries who are more interested in debating whether two swallows could successfully carry a coconut than in guarding their castles. Sir Robin and Sir Lancelot meet as they attempt to dispose of the sickly Not Dead Fred (“He Is Not Dead Yet”). They agree to become Knights of the Round Table together.', 'Meanwhile, Arthur attempts to convince a peasant named Dennis Galahad that he (Arthur) is king of England because the Lady of the Lake gave him Excalibur, the sword given only to the man fit to rule England. However, Dennis and his mother, Mrs. Galahad, are political radicals and deny that any king who has not been elected by the people has any legitimate right to rule over them. To settle the issue, Arthur has the Lady of the Lake and her Laker Girls appear to turn Dennis into a knight (“Come With Me”). Cheered on by the girls (“Laker Girls Cheer”), the Lady of the Lake turns Dennis into Sir Galahad and together, they sing a generic Broadway love song (“The Song That Goes Like This”). Together, with Sir Bedevere and Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Show (a knight resembling Don Quixote who promptly apologizes and then leaves), they make up the Knights of the Round Table (“All for One”).', 'The five knights gather in Camelot, a deliberately anachronistic place resembling Las Vegas’s Camelot-inspired Excalibur resort, complete with showgirls and oversized dice (“Knights of the Round Table” / “The Song That Goes Like This (Reprise)”). In the midst of their revelry, they are contacted by God (voiced by John Cleese) who tells them to locate the Holy Grail. Urged on by the Lady of the Lake (“Find Your Grail”), the Knights set off. They are viciously taunted by lewd French soldiers at a castle they come to, and attempt to retaliate by sending them a large wooden rabbit in the style of the Trojan Horse; however, they realize after the fact that it was not as simple as leaving the rabbit and walking away – they were supposed to be inside of it. Defeated, they leave in a hurry when the French begin throwing various barnyard animals – including cows – at them (“Run Away”).', 'Act II', 'Sir Robin and his minstrels follow King Arthur and Patsy into a “dark and very expensive forest” where they are separated. King Arthur meets the Knights who say Ni, who demand a shrubbery. King Arthur despairs of finding one, but Patsy cheers him up (“Always Look on the Bright Side of Life”) and they find a shrubbery shortly after. The Knights accept it, but next demand that King Arthur put on a musical and bring it to Broadway.', 'The Black Knight appears but King Arthur more or less defeats him by cutting off both his arms and legs, impaling his still-alive torso on a door, and leaving to find Sir Robin. Sir Robin, after wandering the forest for some time (“Brave Sir Robin”), finds King Arthur and insists that it would be impossible for them to accomplish this next task (“You Won’t Succeed on Broadway”). King Arthur and Patsy promptly set off in search of Jews. While the Lady of the Lake laments her lack of stage time (“The Diva’s Lament”), Sir Lancelot receives a letter from what he assumes is a young damsel in distress. He is a little surprised to find that the damsel is actually an effeminate young man named Herbert (“Where Are You?” / “Here Are You”) whose overbearing, music-hating father, the king, is forcing him into an arranged marriage. Lancelot advocates for Herbert after the king returns, and Lancelot is outed as a homosexual in the process (“His Name Is Lancelot”).', 'King Arthur begins to give up hope of ever putting on the Broadway musical and laments that he is alone, even though Patsy has been with him the entire time (“I’m All Alone”). The Lady of the Lake appears and tells Arthur that he and the Knights have been in a Broadway musical all along. All that’s left is for King Arthur to find the Grail and marry someone. After picking up on some not-too-subtle hints, Arthur decides to marry the Lady of the Lake after he finds the Grail (“Twice In Every Show”).', 'Reunited with his Knights, Arthur meets Tim the Enchanter who warns them of the danger of an evil rabbit. When the rabbit bites a knight’s head off, Arthur uses the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch against it, knocking down a nearby hill and revealing that the “evil rabbit” was actually a puppet controlled by a surprised puppeteer. A large stone block showing a combination of letters and numbers is also revealed. After pondering the final clue, Arthur admits that they’re “a bit stumped with the clue thing” and asks God to “give them a hand”. The grail is “found”; Arthur marries the Lady of the Lake (who reveals that her name is Guinevere); Lancelot marries Herbert; and Sir Robin decides to pursue a career in musical theatre (“Act 2 Finale/ Always Look on the Bright Side of Life (Company Bow)”).']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

with its lead cast members Dee Dee Allen and Barry Glickman (“Changing Lives”). The musical is bashed by The New York Times because Dee Dee and Barry do not understand their characters since they are too self involved, resulting in the show closing on opening night. To improve their image, the actors decide to take up “a cause” to appear selfless. They team up with two other actor friends, Trent Oliver, who is an actor and Juilliard School graduate down on his luck but who has just been cast in the non-Equity tour of Godspell, and Angie Dickinson, a life long chorus girl who just quit her job of 20 years in the musical Chicago after the producers never let her go on for the role of Roxie Hart. After searching on Twitter for a cause, they find the story of Emma, a teenager from Indiana who got her school’s prom cancelled because she wanted to bring her girlfriend. Seeing the opportunity, and some personal connection, the actors decide to go to Indiana to help (“Changing Lives (Reprise)”).', 'Back in Indiana, Emma faces severe bullying, but she reminds herself to breathe and that not everyone is this cruel (“Just Breathe”). Mr. Hawkins, the school principal and Emma’s ally, informs her that he has spoken to the States Attorney and that he believes they have a good shot. The school holds a meeting with the PTA to discuss having the prom. As Emma and Mr. Hawkins begin to make progress, Dee Dee, Barry, Angie, and Trent barge in with protest signs to support Emma. Dee Dee reminds everyone what a good person she is for doing this while claiming that this isn’t about her humiliating Emma (“It’s Not About Me”). After the meeting, it is revealed that the girl Emma wants to take to prom is Alyssa, a popular but closeted student and the daughter of the head of the PTA. The two argue as Alyssa blames Emma for all the publicity around the prom but Emma reassures her that she didn’t want this either and that she just wants to be with her (“Dance with You”). The actors attempt to hold a rally to inspire action for Emma but can only book the halftime show at a monster truck rally. They perform alongside the non-Equity cast of Godspell that Trent is on tour with (“The Acceptance Song”). The performance is unsuccessful.', 'It is later learned that the state’s attorney ruled that the school must hold a prom. Emma thanks the actors, and Mr. Hawkins and Dee Dee go to Applebee’s to celebrate. With the prom back on, students begin to “prompose” to each other. Emma officially asks Alyssa to this new prom and she agrees promising to come out to be with her (“You Happened”). At Applebee’s, Mr. Hawkins, a huge fan of Dee Dee’s, tells her how much she inspires him (“We Look to You”). Barry helps Emma get ready for prom and reveals he didn’t have the opportunity to go to prom either. Meanwhile across the town other teens prepare for the prom as well (“Tonight Belongs to You”). As Emma waits outside the gym, she asks Barry to walk her in because she is nervous. As they enter, they realize that the gym is empty. Mr. Hawkins, who is inside desperately trying to resolve the issue, reveals that the PTA put on another prom across town and this one just for Emma as required by law. Dee Dee panics that this fake prom will be bad press for her, which angers Mr. Hawkins as he learns about Dee Dee’s true intentions. Emma calls Alyssa who tells her she knew nothing about the other prom. Emma asks her to come and be with her but she refuses to come out. Devastated, Emma runs out of the gymnasium, asking all the actors to just go home (“Tonight Belongs to You (Reprise)”).', 'Act II', 'Following the fake prom, the media frenzy around the whole event increases. The actors encourage Emma to step up and become the face of the story, but she is too scared. Angie encourages her by teaching her about zazz, a technique from a story about Bob Fosse and the original production of Chicago (“Zazz”). Dee Dee returns to talk to Mr. Hawkins, who berates her for being so self centered. She performs his favorite song by her to make it up to him and vows to begin thinking of others (“The Lady’s Improving”). Trent decides that he may be able to change the minds of the youth of the town due to his small-town upbringing. He confronts a number of the students about how they and their families break the word of the Bible every day and how hypocritical they are being. He encourages them to follow “love thy neighbor” above all (“Love Thy Neighbor”).', 'Alyssa meets with Emma to apologize, telling her about all the pressure her mother puts on her to be perfect and that she blames her for her father leaving. Emma is unable to accept her apology and they break up (“Alyssa Greene”). The actors book Emma a TV appearance, but she refuses, telling them that she has her own plan to control the narrative and change minds. Convinced her plan will work and that they will be able to have a prom for everyone, Emma asks Barry to be her date so that he is finally able to fulfill his dream. Barry, overjoyed, agrees as he recounts his own experience missing prom the first time (“Barry Is Going to Prom”). Emma uploads a video of her singing with her guitar about her struggles and longing for acceptance but how despite that she is proud of who she is and won’t hide anymore. She inspires other members of the LGBTQ+ community in the area and across the country to comment on their support for her and how it has helped them (“Unruly Heart”). The video goes viral, forcing the school to reconsider. The actors want Emma to finally have a prom but the school doesn’t have the money for it.', 'The actors all donate, including Dee Dee, who turns over her American Express Black card. The PTA is furious over the possibility of a new prom but the students voice their support for an inclusive prom, having had their minds changed by Trent. The school, seeing how good Trent is with the kids, offers him a position as a drama teacher. Alyssa comes out to her mother in front of the school, confessing her love for Emma. Mrs. Greene is reluctant to accept Alyssa as she is, but Barry steps in, saying if she doesn’t accept Alyssa she is going to lose her. She is devastated but begins to become more open and agrees to listen to her daughter. The PTA backs down, and quickly makes plans for a new prom, while Dee Dee and Barry question what “success” is. The school puts on this more inclusive prom and LGBT couples from the area attend along with the straight couples of James Madison High School. Emma and Alyssa finally get their dance and share a kiss (“It’s Time to Dance”).']","{'sets': ['White Plains Performing Arts Center', 'Contact Stephen Ferri, Executive Producer', 'stephen@wppac.com', 'www.wppac.com'], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Alice’s older sister, Loreena, is reading a book to Alice, but much to Alice’s disappointment, it is a “book with no pictures.” As Loreena reads aloud a few sentences from the book, a hint of what’s to come is revealed to the audience. Out of sight from Alice, Loreena and the Mother — characters from Wonderland – the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, and Wonderland Flowers – quickly pop up and disappear, illustrating the “missing pictures” that Lorena describes as she reads aloud. The mother hurriedly exits as she instructs Loreena to set up the croquet set and Alice to set up the tea set. Alice is left alone, once again lamenting the “book without pictures,” pondering, “where is the wonder in that?” (That’s How You Get to Wonderland).', 'As the music transitions – now brightly and up-tempo – the White Rabbit scurries in – befuddled and in a great hurry, exclaiming he is late! A startled Alice is quickly surprised by more Wonderland characters who assure her “there’s a place bigger than the biggest of your dreams – Wonderland!” Alice is puzzled and apprehensive, but very intrigued how she might be able to go this magical place – especially a place where she might be treated like a grown-up. Soon she follows each Wonderland character down the rabbit hole, taking the leap to leave her boring English childhood behind.', 'Alice finds herself in a room with many doors of all shapes and sizes. The White Rabbit scurries in again, complaining he is late, and despite Alice’s pleas to “wait,” he quickly goes through a door, shuts it and it locks behind him. Alice, left alone, cannot get any of the doors to work and she is also either too big or too small to fit through many of them. (Curiouser and Curiouser). Wonderland characters pop in and out, offering their comments and advice, though unnoticed by Alice. Suddenly Alice notices a piece of cake with a note, “Take a bite,” which she does, and begins to feel very odd. Then thirsty, she notices a cup of tea with a note, “Take a sip,” which she does and much to her dismay she begins to shrink. But in doing so, she can now fit through a tiny door leading her to a beautiful and colorful Wonderland. (Now That I See Wonderland).', 'The beauty of Wonderland is quickly interrupted by (The Caucus Race) of Wonderland characters, led by the Do-Do Bird who, amid all the chaos, explains to a confused Alice that the race is ordered every year by The Queen of Hearts – though it accomplishes nothing. Alice is swept up in the flurry – and once again a hurried White Rabbit enters joining in the race as well. As the race winds down, all are exhausted, especially the White Rabbit, who is fanning himself with a fan. He sheepishly admits to everyone that the fan actually belongs to the Queen of Hearts – who is dreaded by all. He tries to quickly pass it off – but all refuse – except an innocent Alice who is left holding the fan. The Wonderland characters race to exit as quickly as possible upon hearing mention of the Queen. The kindly Mock Turtle enters in his very slow pace, late as always, this time having missed the Caucus Race. Alice asks him how she might find the Queen to return the fan to her. He advises Alice to “just look for the red roses.” Still unsure of what direction to go, she is suddenly startled by a very large Cheshire Cat, cool and hip, (The Cheshire Cat), who asks Alice, “Who are you?”', 'Alice is surprised to meet yet another curious creature – especially one with a large grin who can partially disappear, leaving only his smile to be seen. The Cheshire Cat advises Alice that when the Queen of Hearts is around his grin “is turned upside down.” Alice still innocently wishes to find her way to the Queen’s court and the Cheshire Cat suggests that on her way she stop and see the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, who are always having tea, adding “Everyone in Wonderland is mad-mad-mad”– including Alice! He vanishes and with a sudden burst of excitement, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum enter to greet Alice. (I’m Tweedle Dee, I’m Tweedle Dum).', 'Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, two silly and childish Wonderland characters, are excited to let Alice know that whenever you can’t remember the lyrics to any song – just insert their names, Dee and Dum, for each musical note. They illustrate to Alice several musical styles and examples – from a Dee and Dum rendition of the ABC’s to a Dee and Dum version of Bizet’s Carmen. With still no help in finding the Queen, Alice follows them off hoping they might lead the way.', 'The Two, Seven, and Five of Hearts are painting all the roses in the Kingdom red – by order of the Queen of Hearts (Painting the Roses Red). They, too, dread her every whim and threat, especially her edict, “Off with their heads!” The Knave of Hearts enters to point out all their faults, since he is a “face card” and has superiority over them. The Knave observes the Five of Hearts is eating tarts – and all suddenly realize they are actually the Queen’s tarts and are terrified of the consequences should she discover they are missing. The Knave offers to return what’s left of the tarts to the Queen though it is clear he really just wants the tarts to himself. Alice – spying red roses – approaches them in hopes she is getting closer to the Queen’s Court. They listen politely to her plight to return the Queen’s fan, but clearly do not wish to be involved, and wearily shuffle off to paint the remaining “3,422 rosebushes.” The Mock Turtle enters, late again, this time for painting the roses. Alice, still impatient to find her way to the Queen, is assured by the Mock Turtle that “all the mysteries will be revealed in time.”', 'Suddenly the easy-going Caterpillar, sitting on a big mushroom, enters along with Wonderland Flowers and offers Alice advice about the “Queenie who can be a meanie” but is probably “not playing with a full deck.” He is happily sipping a straw from a very large over-sized soda and, along with the flowers, tells Alice why he loves Wonderland where you can lay in the sun all day – just hanging out and having fun (I’m a Caterpillar).', 'Alice is confused about everything that is happening to her in Wonderland, and he assures her, “Don’t worry – be happy.” Once again the White Rabbit enters and quickly exits, with Alice still not able to get his attention. Though Alice asks to have a soda, too, the Caterpillar suggests “tea – try down the road!” He is off, along with Wonderland Flowers, with his final advice to “just chill and live in the moment.”', 'Alice stumbles upon a tea party, where the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the Doormouse all announce to her, “No room!” though, as Alice points out to them, there is plenty of room at the table (It’s Always Tea Time). As the four continually shift seats, sipping tea and toasting their teacups, Alice tries to make sense of this odd tea party and conversation. The Mad Hatter reads Alice’s tea leaves and proclaims she is in for a “disastrous adventure,” and curiously wonders if she plays croquet. As the party progresses, they are gradually joined by a large group of Wonderland characters celebrating “the tea party that never ends” with the clock forever stuck on six o’clock. In a parade-like fashion, all except, once again leaving Alice alone.', 'Alice joins the Mock Turtle, who is forlorn and crying to himself. Alice tries to console him as he laments the many reasons why he is so misunderstood. (It May Take a While But You’ll Get There). Though no one understands his leisurely pace, the Mock Turtle explains it is actually the key to truly enjoying and experiencing life. Most importantly, he advises Alice to not be in such a hurry to grow up. They are suddenly interrupted by a fanfare. The Queen is approaching, and the Mock Turtle warns Alice to “Hide!”', 'The Heart Cards enter, singing the praises of the Queen of Hearts, who triumphantly enters. (She’s the Queen of Hearts). She is the center of attention – vain and ready to declare “Off with their heads” to anyone who might offend her, including the King himself. The Queen announces that her beloved tarts have disappeared. She suddenly sees the Knave munching on the tarts and instructs the Mad Hatter to read “the accusation,” and then orders the Knave’s fate, “Off with his head!” The Queen, overcome with all the events, is about to faint and asks for her fan. Alice, pleased to help her, presents the fan to the Queen, who accuses Alice of stealing the fan and also orders her punishment, “Off with her head!” The Mock Turtle comes to Alice’s defense, asking for the Queen to at least allow Alice to have a trial, which briefly amuses the Queen. Ultimately the Mock Turtle suggests a competition where Alice may prove herself worthy of a royal pardon. The Queen declares a game of “sudden death” (Flamingo Croquet) where the first one who scores wins.', 'With flamingos as croquet mallets, the match begins. Though Alice clearly scores the first point, the Queen ignores it. Instead she takes a swing, misses, and instructs the King to place her ball through the wicket, declaring herself the winner. Filled with glee at her victory, the Queen shouts, “Off with all of their heads!” A madcap chase ensues with the King and the Heart Cards protecting Alice from the Queen’s wrath. Suddenly the White Rabbit runs in, exclaiming he is still late! Alice is finally able to ask him why – and he explains to an astonished Alice that all along he has been late – to get her back up the rabbit hole and return her home. Together they escape the chaotic scene.', 'As the English parlor is revealed once again, the audience discovers that Alice has simply fallen asleep while reading her book, leaving them to believe that Alice has only dreamed of her adventure to Wonderland. The Mother enters and tells Alice that she has reconsidered and Alice can join the “grown-up party” after all. Alice declines – explaining that she prefers to just stay in the parlor to read her book – having been reminded just recently that there is plenty of time for growing up. As the Mother exits, a bit of mystery still remains. Wondering if Wonderland did exist after all, she spies the Mad Hatter’s hat on the parlor’s hat rack – and the Wonderland characters re-appear, re-assuring her it wasn’t a dream after all. (That’s How You Get to Wonderland Reprise). She takes the Mad Hatter’s hat, puts it on her head and smiles, and the curtain falls.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Having sent for a boy to help out on the farm, Marilla insists that she be returned to the orphanage, but when she learns of Anne’s difficult childhood she decides to allow Anne to stay and raise her properly. With a vivid imagination, the red-headed, freckle-faced Anne takes much joy in life and is\xa0never at a loss for chattering about how she feels – often driving the prim, duty-driven Marilla\xa0to distraction. But shy Matthew falls for her immediately, and they become what Anne calls \xa0“kindred spirits.” Audiences will delight in Anne’s humorous adventures at school – her friendship with Diana\xa0Barry, her “bosom friend” – her academic rivalry with classmate Gilbert Blythe who, having\xa0teased her about her red hair, earned Anne’s instant and ongoing hatred – and Anne’s\xa0endearing way of getting into trouble, yet finding ways to make it all work out. The once quiet lifestyle of the small farming community will never be the same. Near the end of the musical, the happy anticipation of Anne furthering her education and earning her teaching certificate is turned to sadness when her friend, the kindly \xa0Matthew, suddenly dies. Soon after, Marilla decides to sell the farm at Green Gables – as she cannot manage it on her own. Learning of this, Anne decides to give up her ambition of going away to school and stay at Green Gables to care for Marilla and help manage the farm. When Gilbert hears of Anne’s self-sacrifice, he offers his help – and the two finally reconcile. \xa0Anne, however, is determined and stubborn as ever. She decides that she will earn her teaching\xa0degree at home through correspondence, that she and Marilla will be just fine, and that “all’s right with the world.”']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Anyone, that is, except Awesome Allie. Called from across the sky and tapped by the President himself, Allie soon sets out in her dance-powered spaceship on a journey through the stars, soaring from Earth to Pluto with only a trusty, talking dog named Captain Chaos by her side. Along the way, she’ll meet unlikely challenges and unlikelier friends, from the disco dancing land rover stranded on Mars, to the world’s smartest supercomputer, PAL 9000. She’ll learn the order of the planets and lots of fun facts about the solar system, and she’ll need the whole audience’s help if she’s going to dance her ship all the way to Pluto. But what does this Alien want? What is it that’s worth crossing the entire solar system to find?

The role of Milo can be either male or female, and because Milo is actually Sam’s imaginary friend, Milo could be the same age as Sam or any age. Milo is a little less mature than Sam, more mischievous and irresponsible. He/she feeds Sam’s imaginative life and often leads Sam astray. As is revealed towards the end of Act One, Milo is Sam’s imaginary friend, so in a sense, Milo is who Sam wishes he/she could be but isn’t brave enough for – at the beginning of our story at least. Milo, too, matures as the story develops.', 'Alice – Same age as Sam and Milo, a girl in Sam’s year at his new school. Alice is strong, brave and serious. The Headmaster’s “upgrading” technique has turned her beloved sister Jess into an unfeeling robot of a girl, so Alice is shut off emotionally from the other children, bitter and untrusting – at least at first. When she realises Sam will stick by her, she reveals her kinder, more vulnerable side.', 'Their Classmates', 'Dexter – A friendly, happy boy who is very much at ease with knowing that he’s not very smart. Simple tasks – such as tying his shoelaces – defeat him, but he has a lot of charm.', 'Grace – A good girl, clever, hardworking and serious. Finds breaking school rules very difficult, even when she knows she has to – but can be very brave.', 'Harvey – The cool kid. Confident, charming, charismatic – but not very academic.', 'Helen – The shy girl, nervous about going to the new school. Good-hearted but quiet.', 'The New Kids – Classmates of the above.', 'The Big Kids – All have been transformed by the Headmaster’s “upgrading” technique into robot-like drones, who move and think in a rigidly controlled manner.', 'Jess – One of the Big Kids. Alice’s older sister. We first see her as the poster girl for “upgrading”: severe, serious, unfeeling, hostile. But Alice’s memory of her offers us a glimpse of the girl she used to be, creative, guitar-playing and loving.', 'The Parents', 'Beth – Sam’s mother. A single mother, she’s done everything she can to make Sam’s life interesting and colourful – despite there not being much money about. At the beginning of the story, she and Sam have just moved out of their small flat and into a little house, so things are looking up economically, but she worries that Sam is stuck emotionally – he still has an imaginary friend, even though he’s old enough for secondary school – and she blames herself for indulging his taste for fantasy and daydreaming.', 'Flick – Dexter’s mum. Loving but despairing about her son’s inability to perform basic tasks, she’s sending him to this school because she’s heard how they get amazing exam results out of even the most unpromising students.', 'Liam and Marco – Grace’s dads. Very proud indeed of their academically gifted daughter but also rather emotional about her first day at secondary school. She’s very relaxed about it, they’re the ones feeling the separation anxiety.', 'Tony – Harvey’s dad. An important corporate boss. Very strait-laced and disciplined. Cares a lot about results.', 'Tash – Helen’s mum. Caring but perhaps a little exasperated by her daughter’s shyness.', 'The Staff', 'The Headmaster – 45 years old. Brilliant, charismatic and megalomaniac, the Headmaster is an evil genius who has developed an “upgrading” technique that removes the imagination from his students, and so enables them to pass exams with machine-like efficiency. This, he hopes, will eventually result in world domination. He had an unhappy childhood, as we see when we flashback to the Boy Headmaster – a miniature version of his older self. His parents encouraged his inventing but then broke his heart when they told him that his best friend was imaginary. In love with – or at least, strangely drawn to – Miss Stoker.', 'Miss Stoker – The I.T. teacher. Cold-hearted and ruthless, and admiringly in love with the Headmaster.', 'Dr Goole – The Mathematics teacher. Evil, like his colleagues, the only thing he regrets about the Headmaster’s “upgrading” is that the pupils are never naughty, and so cannot be punished.', 'Frau Rammstein – The Business Studies teacher. A scary, Wagnerian person, she speaks with a heavy German accent.', 'Mr Gruntt – The P.E. Teacher. As his name suggests, Gruntt cannot speak – he communicates in grunts that we, the audience, don’t understand, but that the other teachers somehow seem to understand perfectly. As the story develops, we realise that what he’s trying to say every time is “Oogie”, which is the name of his long-lost imaginary friend. During “upgrading” sessions, Gruntt assists the Headmaster, playing Igor to his Frankenstein. Reunited with Oogie, he repents and reveals his good side.', 'The Minister of Education –\xa0Charming, devious and utterly unreliable. A future Prime Minister.', 'The “IFs” or Imaginary Friends', 'Big Brenda – The weirdest, craziest-looking creature you’ve ever seen, there is no doubt that Brenda was the product of a child’s very fertile imagination. Initially charming and motherly – and presiding over an Imaginary Land that is one long party – we later discover that she rules Imaginary Land with a rod of iron – locking the gates that separate it from the real world, and making all newly-arrived IFs forget their human friends. We learn this is because she was once the Boy Headmaster’s IF, but they fell out and he punished her by transforming her from Brenda Jr – a human-looking child – into the monstrously improbable creature she is today. Female, but could be played by a male actor, in the English “Pantomime Dame” tradition.', 'The Brendettes – Big Brenda’s henchpersons and backing singers. Cool, superior and fabulous.', 'Oogie – The one rebel in Imaginary Land. Oogie is an IF who has refused to forget his human friend. He lives in hope of his friend communicating with him, and so has stayed by the large telephone that the humans can use to call their IFs back into their lives. Alas, the phone has not rung in all the many, many years since Oogie arrived and his faith is beginning to run out. But he’s an irrepressible character – quick to embrace hope and eager to do anything to help Milo, his new best friend.', 'Chutney, Mutley and Frank – Three IF friends']",https://www.theatricalrights.com/apply-for-a-license/?select-show=imaginary,"

As they play in the small garden of Sam’s new house, they use their imaginations to turn the ordinary world around them into a place of wonder and adventure. Sam’s mum comes to tell him it’s time to go in: tomorrow is his first day at secondary school and he has to stop playing and grow up.', 'When Sam and Milo arrive at the school the next morning, they notice something strange about the older pupils. Their super-disciplined way of moving and speaking puts Milo in mind of “Martian battle robots”. The Headmaster explains to the new arrivals that this is the result of his pioneering teaching technique and these “upgraded” pupils are guaranteed exam success.', 'As the term goes on, more and more of Sam’s classmates are sent to the Headmaster’s office to be upgraded. Sam has made friends with another pupil, Alice, who knows there’s something sinister behind all this: one of the upgraded pupils is her sister, whose kindness and creativity have been extinguished by the process. Sam vows to help Alice stop the Headmaster and set the upgraded pupils free. It won’t be easy but Sam believes that the code of loyalty he learned when having imaginary adventures with Milo – “never leave a man behind” – will give them the strength to defeat the forces of darkness.', 'Milo, meanwhile, has grown jealous of Alice, but when he tells Sam to stop spending time with her, Sam refuses. Milo persists until Sam loses his temper and tells Milo a terrible truth: Milo isn’t real – he’s Sam’s imaginary friend. At first, Milo refuses to believe this, but as the realisation sinks in, he is visited by Big Brenda, an extraordinary-looking creature who has come to take him to Imaginary Land, the place where all “IFs” (imaginary friends) are sent once their human friends no longer believe in them.', 'Act Two', 'Milo arrives in Imaginary Land. Life there is one long party for the IFs but Milo is still unhappy and won’t join in so Brenda tricks him into forgetting Sam.', 'Meanwhile, in the real world, Sam and Alice need to get into the Headmaster’s office so they can find out the truth about his upgrading technique and stop it. The office is locked, so they sneak into the Staff Room to steal the key but, before they can escape, the Teachers appear. Sam and Alice hide while the Teachers reminisce about how happy they were in the days before upgrading – when children were still naughty and could be punished. Just as they’re about to leave, Alice is discovered, captured and upgraded. Sam is now alone and he doesn’t know what to do.', 'In Imaginary Land, Milo meets Oogie – the only IF who won’t join Big Brenda’s party and forget his human friend. As Sam’s mum encourages Sam to bring Milo back if that’s what will solve his problems, Oogie helps Milo remember Sam. Sam and Milo reconnect, and Milo promises to return to the real world and help Sam.', 'He’ll have to hurry: Sam is being hunted! The Minister of Education is going to visit the school and the Headmaster needs Sam so he can demonstrate his upgrading technique. This is a big deal for the Headmaster. If the Minister approves his technique, all the children in the country – the world – will be upgraded!', 'Milo, meanwhile, finds that Big Brenda has locked the doors of Imaginary Land so he can’t get back and help Sam. Oogie distracts the other IFs with a song and dance so that Milo can escape – but he might already be too late! Sam has been captured and sent to the Headmaster’s office. There, he discovers, the Headmaster – and his vile, PE-teaching henchman Mr Gruntt – have a machine that can actually remove a pupil’s imagination. That’s what “upgrading” means! The Headmaster keeps the imaginations of all the pupils in jars, like trophies – and Sam’s is next. Sam fights the machine with all his mental powers. He’s just about to go under when Milo returns. Their united imaginations are strong enough to make the Headmaster’s machine malfunction. Out of spite, the Headmaster activates the machine’s doomsday function and threatens to blow up the world. Just before the countdown reaches zero, Big Brenda bursts in, looking for Milo. Amazingly, she turns out to be the Headmaster’s long-lost IF! Reunited with Brenda, the Headmaster repents and promises to undo all his evil work. Oogie is reunited with his human friend, Mr Gruntt, and Milo and Sam set all the other children free – including Alice.', 'The IFs realise that they must leave the real world so that their human friends can grow and be happy. Sam is devastated that he will never see Milo again, but Milo tells him he has Alice now. And, besides, Milo was a part of Sam so he will always be with him – in every wild and brilliant thought, every laugh, every stupid game. Everything imaginary.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Smedley Elementary School, and four students (Adam, Allison, Cheryl, and Gregory) are singing the school Alma Mater (“Alma Mater”). The janitor, Pop Hanson, explains that these students, in Miss Nelson’s class, are complete nightmares. We now see them in action in their classroom. Instead of calmly listening to the story of Pinocchio, they are disruptive, rude, and completely disrespectful to their teacher. Miss Nelson complains about her lack of control (“The Worst Kids Of All”) and concludes that something must be done about this situation.', 'It is the next day. Mr. Blandsworth, the principal, enters and laments his life (“Carried Away”) and then explains that Miss Nelson will not be in today. Instead, the students meet Miss Viola Swamp- at first a shadow at the door- and then a very real, very terrifying substitute teacher. She demands respect and explains the consequences of disobedience in class (“The Swamp Song”). Swamp begins the lesson, and the children are suddenly attentive and responsive.', 'Time passes and there is no sign of Miss Nelson. The homework assignments pile up. The students go in search of their teacher but to no avail. They speculate about what may have happened to Miss Nelson (“What If”) and head to the Police Station to get some official assistance in their search.', 'At the Police Station, Detective McSmogg is, unfortunately, very little help. He creates an elaborate plan to search the entire globe for the missing teacher (“McSmogg Is Here”) and the students start to lose confidence. They meet at the local Ice Cream Shoppe and write a letter to Miss Nelson, begging her to return and promising to be better behaved (“Miss Nelson Is Missing”).', 'At school the next day, the students have proven they have changed. They are helping the janitor clean and comparing notes on their homework assignments, when in walks Miss Nelson! She is now able to successfully continue with the story of Pinocchio, and the students realize they now have the same qualities that turned Pinocchio into a real boy: obedience, unselfishness, and respect.', 'Later that evening, Miss Nelson is at home and singing to herself about a little secret she has been carrying: Miss Viola Swamp was really Miss Nelson in disguise (“The Secret Song”)!', 'Back at school (“Alma Mater Reprise”), we see that the students are continuing their good behavior. Pop Hanson explains that Detective McSmogg is now working on a new case: the missing Viola Swamp (“Finale”)!']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Iris is a bright 8-year-old, who lives “in a place called the Bronx, in the Kingdom of 3rd Avenue… in the Land of New York City,” with her big sister named Shorty the Fortune Teller because she always seems to know what’s going to happen, a Mami named Mami the Busy because she was always busy doing something, and a Papi named Papi the Clever “who with the touch of a hand and about five or six hours could fix anything.” She also lives with a dog they called El Exigente simply because they all loved him so much. One day they decide to take a trip to the Enchanted State Park. Iris’ Aunt Carmen the Beautiful and her brand new husband Juan show up, as does Don Joe who owns the deli.\xa0 The whole bunch packs the car with more paraphernalia than they could possibly need, even while trying to heed Papi’s advice, singing “Just Bring What You Need.” As everyone climbs into the car, Iris calls for El Exigente to join them, but Shorty protests. Mami and Papi agree that taking the dog on a family picnic is a bad idea. They instruct Iris to leave El Exigente at home.\xa0 Iris doesn’t know whether to obey or not and shares her dilemma with us in the song “I Don’t Know What to Do.” By the end of the song Iris makes a decision… she sneaks El Exigente into the back of the car! No one notices and before too long they are off to the park singing “We’re On the Way.” (Dog and all!)', 'As Shorty predicts, the car breaks down. Papi gets to the business of fixing it. As they all wait, Don Joe makes sandwiches while singing “A Sandwich for Everyone,” and El Exigente manages to steal and eat every single sandwich while remaining undiscovered! Iris manages to chase El Exigente away from the sandwiches giving Carmen and Juan the opportunity to demonstrate their love for each other as they sing and dance with their eyes closed, “We Know Each Other Perfectly.” As they dance, they nearly run into the unseen El Exigente throughout! Papi announces that the car is fixed and everyone piles back in, with Iris again smuggling El Exigente aboard. After a short while Papi realizes that he is lost! They seek directions from a Police Officer in “Directions.”\xa0 Shorty suggests they write the directions down but she is overruled.\xa0 They hit the road and realize that they cannot remember what the Police Officer told them, just as Shorty had predicted. She laments her situation in “It Isn’t Easy Always Being Right.” Finally, they reach the Enchanted State Park. As they approach, Iris sees the sign… “No Dogs Allowed!” as the family sings “We’re Here/No Dogs Allowed.” As they pile out of the car, Iris can no longer control El Exigente who barks and bounds out of the back seat. The stowaway is discovered!!', 'As they sing, “Exigente,” Iris admits that she smuggled him aboard. Then, Shorty points out that they have a dog where there are no dogs allowed.\xa0 El Exigente’s feelings are hurt and he runs away into the theater! Everyone enlists the help of the audience in finding El Exigente. When they do, the whole crew excitedly greets their dog until the question of Iris disobeying her parents is raised in, “The Trial of Iris.” In response, “Iris Explains.” How does it all resolve? The title “Give Us a Hug,” is a pretty good clue! Iris is forgiven but El Exigente is still not allowed to enter the park.\xa0 What to do? They take turns staying with Exigente in the parking lot, allowing each and every one of them to enjoy some time in the park. In the end, they each spend quality time with the dog until darkness falls and it’s time to pack up and go home.\xa0 Iris comments that though they had so much trouble, she feels like they spent a terrific day at the park.\xa0 All agree as they sing “Great Day After All.”']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

As the music swells to its conclusion, Holmes and Watson appear. “Come Watson! The game’s afoot!” announces Holmes – as they exit and the show begins.', 'On busy Baker Street, people are mulling about, musing that The Game’s Afoot as they observe the many curious people they see there. A group of young street urchins enter – they are the “Baker Street Irregulars”– Sherlock Holmes’ eyes and ears on the streets of London who help in solving some of Holmes’ most baffling cases. Their leader is Wiggins, a colorful character who aspires to be a master detective one day. A young lad named Georgie wanders in and tells Wiggins he’s an orphan who has come to London to make his way in the world. Wiggins explains that he and his friends work for a consulting detective named Sherlock Holmes who pays them well for clues. After they test Georgie’s powers of deduction, Wiggins – who thinks he’s a natural – says “yer in!”', 'The scene transitions to Holmes’ and Watson’s rooms at 221-B Baker Street and we hear Holmes playing a sonata on his violin, which he claims helps him concentrate and solve some of his most perplexing cases. Holmes asks Watson to come to the window, observe a curious fellow walking down the street, and use his powers of deduction to tell what he can surmise about the man. Although Watson tries his best to use The Art of Deduction, Holmes points out that his conclusions are all wrong and explains to Watson how he was mistaken. Just then, Mrs. Hudson shows the curious man in, and he announces he is the Queen’s bodyguard, though Holmes had already deduced this before he had even arrived. He advises Holmes he has come from Queen Victoria herself to engage him in finding a missing crown jewel, the Star of India, stolen from the Tower of London. Watson finds the Bodyguard most irritable and demanding. Yet – for the sake of the Empire – Holmes takes the case, saying he will engage the services of the Baker Street Irregulars to help look for clues.', 'Later, the Irregulars meet, and Wiggins tells the boys that Holmes has hired them to help on his latest case. Just then, Lestrade walks by and suspiciously asks the boys if they know anything about the jewel thefts that are happening around town. They cleverly evade his questions, and although he tells them that Scotland Yard pays well for information, Wiggins says that Sherlock Holmes pays better! When Lestrade leaves, Wiggins tells the lads that The Case is Most Irregular and that they need to get on it right away. He begins handing out assignments, sending them out to various parts of London, and seizing an opportunity to instruct newcomer, Georgie, in the finer methods of deduction, Wiggins takes Georgie with him. As they run off, Georgie literally runs into a man who peers at him interestingly. It is Professor Moriarty. Moriarty notices that Georgie is wearing a fancy ring on a chain around his neck and offers to buy it. Georgie tells him it’s not for sale when Tilly – Moriarty’s henchwoman enters and purposefully bumps into Georgie as he hurriedly runs off.', 'Tilly meets with Moriarty and hands him a handful of jewels. Moriarty scolds her for doing business in public and tells her that he is in total control of the situation and that all is going according to plan. When Tilly tells him Holmes is on the case, Moriatry tells her that He’s No Match for Me. Afterward, Moriarty tells Tilly not to worry about Lestrade, but keep an eye on Holmes and the Irregulars – they might get in the way.', 'Back at Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson eavesdrops on Holmes and Watson as they discuss the new case and offers her services as a consulting detective which Holmes ignores, simply asking her for tea and biscuits. She comments to Holmes and Watson about some of their former cases and says that she could have easily solved the Curious Clues if they’d only listened to her. Later – using a map of the City of London, Holmes plots out the location of the jewel thefts and tells Watson that there is seemingly a pattern to the location of the heists and that he believes it could only be Moriarty who is behind them and he must have a greater evil scheme in mind.', 'In a London alleyway, Tilly meets up with Moriarty who gives her a myriad of jobs to accomplish. As he leaves, Tilly is upset that the Professor piles on the work and never gives her credit for all she is doing. She muses that she is so much smarter than the Professor knows and she smugly exclaims Don’t Mess with Tilly.', 'The ensemble muses once again that The Game’s Afoot as Holmes and Watson arrive at one of the jewelry stores where a jewel heist has taken place the night before. Inspector Lestrade and his men are there and tell Holmes they have thoroughly gone over the scene and have found no clues. Magnifying glass in hand, Holmes meticulously inspects every nook and cranny – The Art of Deduction Instrumental 2 – and finds several clues Lestrade has overlooked. Holmes deduces that two robbers were actually involved in the theft – a tall man who smokes a certain variety of tobacco and a small woman who came in through the window. Wiggins and Georgie enter giving Holmes an update on their findings. Holmes greets Georgie, glad to have him on the team. Holmes gives them each further assignments and tells Watson he has an errand for him at the Royal Library. As all exit, Tilly emerges, having eavesdropped on Holmes’ observations. She slyly proclaims once again Don’t Mess with Tilly. (Reprise).', 'At 221-B Baker Street, Holmes is playing his Lovely Violin, contemplating the set of clues around the London jewelry heists. He knows the clues are leading him to “his old friend” Moriarty, but with “every dance of the bow” he resolves that he will indeed solve the case.', 'On a London street, Wiggins continues to school the Irregulars in Holmes’ philosophy of deduction. Wiggins challenges Georgie that there’s something about him he “just can’t figure out.” The Irregulars agree and observe that Georgie speaks in a more refined manner, holds his tea cup “with his little pinky up” and he’s far too “polite.” Georgie is flustered, but is assured of their friendship. He is relieved that They Likes Me Just Fine.', 'At Covent Garden, people are milling about as Tilly and Moriarty enter. An old man with a fruit cart asks Moriarty if he would like to buy an apple. Moriarty dismisses him, though Tilly says she’ll “’ave one a’ them” – though she is shocked at the price of two pennies. She is clearly impressed with herself and pleased to report to Moriarty everything that she has recently observed about Holmes and Lestrade. However, she doesn’t like “our friend” at all, “prancing about and smoking cigars” while she does all the work. Moriarty assures her that the “friend” serves a “necessary purpose.” Moriarty is confident that the “royal package” will soon be delivered to them, but by none other than “Lestrade himself.” As they begin to exit, Georgie and Wiggins are not far behind, following them – but not before Wiggins steals an apple from the old man’s cart. Wiggins and Georgie still agree The Case Is Most Irregular (Reprise) – but are determined to help solve it. Doctor Watson enters, is very befuddled as the old man engages him in a conversation and seems to know many details about Watson’s life. Suddenly, the old man removes his disguise, revealing to Watson that in actuality he is Sherlock Holmes – then hurries along to further pursue the case.', 'While Holmes and Watson are out, Mrs. Hudson is back at 221-B Baker Street. It is Mrs. Hudson’s Lament that she is always kept in the dark on all of Mr. Holmes’ cases. One by one, visitors come and go – from Inspector Lestrade to the Baker Street Irregulars, to the Queen’s Bodyguard. She grudgingly informs all of them, “Mr. Holmes is out and as usual I have no idea where he is or when he’ll be back.” Finally Dr. Watson arrives, looking for Holmes – hoping he picked up the books Watson had retrieved from the Royal Library. She confirms to Dr. Watson her ongoing frustrations that she has no idea where Holmes is. Watson assures her that “Mr. Holmes often leaves me in the dark as well.” Mrs. Hudson is still certain that she would “make a fair detective.”', 'In a London Alley, Wiggins brags to the Irregulars that he helped himself to a “little dessert” while practicing his “slight of hand” and stole an apple from an old man’s fruit cart. He promises to go back tomorrow and give the old man a tuppence – and asks his friends if any of them “got one?” Georgie reaches into his pocket for the tuppence and is shocked to pull out instead a string of pearls and jewelry. The Irregulars accuse him of stealing the jewels and just as he is defending herself, Lestrade enters, and seeing him with the jewels, proclaims him and all the Irregulars just “a bunch of petty thieves.” Wiggins confirms Lestrade is right about Georgie – he is a thief because he stole the jewels from him. Protecting Georgie and all the Irregulars, Wiggins takes the fall is hauled off to Scotland Yard by Lestrade. Together the Irregulars conclude that Tilly must have planted the jewels on Georgie when she deliberately bumped into him – creating a distraction for Lestrade and Scotland Yard. The Irregulars rush to find Holmes and seek his help to free Wiggins.', 'Back at 221-B Baker Street, Holmes advises Watson that he had “an interesting visit” with his “friends at the London Times” – Watson’s research from the Royal Library has proved to be “most essential” to the case – and the Irregulars recently provided him with “some important news.” Holmes is off to meet with Lestrade and reminds Watson he will have Lestrade meet him later at the “arranged place” – “the center of the hexagon.” Holmes declares the “British crown is at stake” and advises Watson to bring his “army service revolver.”', 'And The Fog Rolls In, as the ensemble enters, commenting that there is danger in the air – so beware! The chimes of Big Ben are heard once again as the scene shifts to the Tower of London where Moriarty is waiting for Holmes, who appears. The two meet at last.', 'Moriarty boasts that Holmes’ methods are so predictable and he knew that he would come. Holmes announces that he is well aware of Moriarty’s true objective – the theft of a “single jewel” that Moriarty claims is so priceless that Queen Victoria will give him anything he wants for its return – in fact, a “Queen’s ransom.” Moriarty takes the Star of India from his pocket – tosses it to Holmes so he may see it one last time – and in that moment, as Holmes lunges for the jewel, Moriarty grabs a fencing sword from the crown jewel case – thrusting it at Holmes – who also grabs a sword and the two begin The Duel. As the fencing match intensifies, Moriarty claims he is the superior swordsman, but as they lock swords, Holmes reveals, that “on the contrary” he “studied with Captain Hutton” a famous expert in obsolete fencing. Holmes out-maneuvers Moriarty, disarming him.', 'Suddenly Wiggins and the Baker Street Irregulars enter. Their entrance distracts the two men, as Moriarty grabs his sword – then Georgie, and holds him captive. Holmes commands Moriarty to release Georgie, but he refuses and begins to leave. Wanting to rescue their friends, the Irregulars charge and overtake Moriarty, causing him to drop his sword and allowing Georgie to go free. Moriarty escapes, warning Holmes, “We’ll meet again!” The Irregulars exclaim that Moriarty is getting away, but Holmes assures them that Doctor Watson and the entire London Police force have been waiting outside the Tower of London for quite some time. Just then, Wiggins spies the Star of India, picking it up and presenting it to Holmes who declares it a “priceless piece of British history.” Lestrade enters with Moriarty in handcuffs. Moriarty is still confident that next time he’ll be “the one who wins.” A London Bobby then brings in Tilly, also in handcuffs. Holmes reminds her that “two can play at this game.” As Lestrade, Moriarty, the London Bobby and Tilly exit, Watson is pleased the case is sewn up and promises that his readers are sure to enjoy his account of the story in his upcoming chronicles. Holmes advises him to “not write your story yet” and to “come along for a bit of unfinished business at 221-B Baker Street.”', 'The Ensemble once again reminds all that The Game’s Afoot (Reprise) – with clues that have yet to be revealed. Watson, the Irregulars and Lestrade all assemble at 221-B Baker Street wondering why Holmes has summoned them there. Suddenly all our astounded when Queen Victoria and her Bodyguard enter, where, she too is puzzled as to why Holmes has called her there. Holmes presents the Star of India to the Queen who expresses her gratitude to him and that of the British Empire. All feel the case has been solved, but Holmes announces, “The real jewel is still missing.” He explains that Moriarty created a series of jewelry robberies to distract Holmes and Scotland Yard – then steal the Star of India to further distract everyone as he stole “a jewel even more valuable.” With the Queen still baffled, Holmes further explains Moriarty wasn’t counting on the loyalty of friendship, as Wiggins took the fall for Georgie. Holmes reveals that the jewels had indeed been planted on Georgie so that he would be taken to jail', 'where a “boy of little interest” could be easily taken away by the “not-so-trustworthy Captain of the Royal Guard!”', 'The Queen’s Bodyguard is outraged as Holmes announces, “Here’s your crown jewel thief, Lestrade, the accomplice of one Professor Moriarty.” The Bodyguard vehemently denies in being involved in any schemes of Moriarty’s – or being an accomplice to Tilly. He pulls out his sword from his cane, warning all to “Stay back!” Just then, Queen Victoria takes her cane and whacks him over the head, bringing him down. Lestrade handcuffs him and leads him off. Watson asks, “So the jewel thief is caught? What else is missing?’', 'Holmes explains that while disguised as a fruit seller in Covent Garden, he had overheard Moriarty and Tilly’s plan, noticed Wiggins steal his apple, and most importantly had noticed the ring that was hanging around Georgie’s neck. As Holmes confirms, it was a crest he had seen before, a perfect hexagon that was the center of Moriarty’s true plan. Thanks to Watson’s “expert research” at the Royal Library, Holmes discovered the signet ring was indeed the crest of the house of Hanover. Holmes further reveals that his own research at the London times provided him with information about a missing “jewel, so to speak” from the crown. Holmes removes Georgie’s cap, and her long hair tumbles out, revealing that he is actually a she, the real missing jewel of the House of Hanover, Queen Victoria’s niece , Georgiana Andrea Elisabeth Catherine – third Duchess of York – fourth Duchess of Kent. The Queen is overwhelmed with joy to find her long missing niece and the Irregulars are shocked, as Wiggins exclaims, “Blimey! You’re a girl!” Georgie explains she was disguised as boy in order to find work in London. She adds that she had no idea she was ever a member of the Royal Family as her parents, who lived in the country, had died when she was very young and she had been taken in by friends. Queen Victoria and her niece embrace and she thanks Sherlock Holmes for returning the “missing jewel” to her and solving the intriguing case. Delighted to be of service to the crown, Holmes calls down to Mrs. Hudson to bring up “cookies for the boys.” As the Queen had been secretly squired into Holmes’ room unbeknownst to Mrs. Hudson, she enters, and shocked to see the Queen, faints into the arms of Dr. Watson. Holmes assures the Queen that when Mrs. Hudson recovers, “you’ll find her biscuits most delicious.”', 'With the case resolved, the ensemble enters, as all muse that The Game’s Afoot (Finale) still – with many mysteries yet to be solved as Holmes is summoned back to Scotland Yard “for a case of the utmost importance!” The curtain falls.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

At bedtime, Snow White and her Nursemaid are excitedly talking about Snow White’s birthday ball which will take place the next day. Snow White admits she is nervous and afraid to dance, but is reassured that anything can happen – and Snow White muses she may find her dreams coming true with Just One Dance. At the Ball, all of Snow White’s fears are forgotten when she meets the charming Prince Philippe who teaches her how to dance the Waltz and they both immediately fall in love! But when the Evil Queen makes her grand entrance, she sends Snow White to bed and quickly turns Snow White’s birthday ball into her own party. Meanwhile up in the Queen’s chambers, the Mirror ponders what life might be like living somewhere else – but then admits with remorse: “No – I Got the Queen.” After the ball, the Queen stops by the Mirror for a little vanity boost, but upon hearing the Queen’s request of “Who’s the fairest?” the Mirror truthfully replies “Snow White is now more beautiful than you!” Enraged, the Evil Queen decides to send Snow White to the dungeon in the morning. Overhearing the Evil Queen’s plan, the Nursemaid quickly tells Snow White that she must flee the Castle immediately and hide in the forest. A frightened Snow White is encouraged by her loving nursemaid to hurry On Your Way – and who knows what great things adventures she may find!', 'At home, Prince Philippe cannot sleep – he is so struck with love for Snow White. Rupert, his friend and valet, encourages him to get some sleep and that he can see her in the morning. Reluctantly, the Prince falls asleep thinking about his Waltz with Snow – the Waltz Reprise – to which Rupert comments “Ah, love! Very good, sir!” First thing in the morning, the Evil Queen goes to Snow White’s bedchamber only to find her missing and summons her guards to find her immediately. But Snow White is far off in the woods where she meets the seven “dwarves” who declare “people call us dwarves but we would like to recommend that you don’t put a label on us – just call us friends!” She is immediately taken with her new, happy, singing and rhyming friends – but the wily dwarves sense danger and invite Snow White to stay with them. At the Palace, the Prince and Rupert stop by to see Snow White and her reluctant Nursemaid admits to them that she has fled into the forest – and the Prince declares that he will go after her to protect her. The Queen, however, conjures up a new plan to subdue Snow White and once again become the Fairest One of All – and she and the Mirror also venture into the forest.', 'At the Dwarves house, all is well and Snow White has been enjoying cooking, baking, and making lunches for the Dwarves – just doing Every Little Thing for them. When they leave for their work, the Evil Queen, disguised as a old hag, arrives at the Dwarves’ house brining treats and, in particular, a candy apple with hazelnut topping – Snow White’s favorite! The hag tempts Snow with the apple urging her to take Just One Bite. Wandering lost through the forest, the Prince and Rupert are suddenly surrounded by the Dwarves who think they have come to harm Snow White. They engage in a Forest Rumble and the clever Dwarves are victorious. But soon they explain that they have come to save Snow White and the Dwarves lead them to her. Back at the house, Snow White cannot resist taking a bite of the candy apple and falls to the floor in a deep sleep as the Evil Queen rejoices to be the fairest once gain. When the Prince, Rupert and the Dwarves arrive, they are heartbroken when they find Snow White deep in the spell. They all mourn her – but Rupert reminds the Prince that he had once said that love could conquer all evil. The Prince kisses Snow White and she awakes – and together they pledge that their Love Can Never Die.', 'Once all has been restored, the Prince, Snow White and the mighty Dwarves head to the palace determined to once-and-for-all put a stop to the Queen. At the palace the Evil Queen engages them all in a Confrontation and – though the Dwarves have subdued the guards, and the Prince valiantly takes a stand, the Queen begins to conjure up a spell that will turn Snow White and the Prince both into stone forever. As she casts the evil spell, the Mirror boldly jumps in front of the Snow White and the Prince – and the spell is reflected in the mirror and reversed back to the Queen – who, herself, is turned to stone! All is well – the Prince and Snow White are together, the Dwarves come to live in the Prince’s Palace, Rupert and the Nursemaid find love, the statue of the Queen is placed in the garden as a planter, and the Mirror proclaims in the Waltz Finale that all will now live “Happily ever after!”']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

They promise the audience they always make up for whatever they did, so it’s okay to be a StinkyKid. Then there’s Britt: She never gets in trouble.\xa0 And she loves to make her friends happy.\xa0 In fact, she’s convinced her parents to drive everyone tomorrow to the brand new MegaJumper 3000 at Captain Happy’s Jumpy-Fun-Super-Bouncy Indoor Place. Jen and Hannah, her two best friends, fight over who will sit next to Britt. They press her to decide who’s her number one bestest best friend, because no one can like everything the same.\xa0 Britt says she can.\xa0 Jen and Hannah each offer Britt a piece of gum as a test. Britt makes peace by taking both pieces, and chews a huge wad of gum.', 'The next morning she wakes up with a huge pink wad in her beautiful red hair. She fears catastrophe: that her parents will cancel the Captain Happy’s outing if they find out she didn’t listen to them when they told her not to go to bed while chewing gum. Hannah and the boys each arrive one by one and try to use his or her mischievous skills to find a solution. Despite Max’s brawn, Hannah’s ingenuity, Johnny’s wackiness and Billy’s science knowhow, nothing works.\xa0 Hannah swears she will help Britt no matter what – after all, she is Britt’s number one bestest best friend, not Jen, right? Britt decides to take a desperate measure: she learns from one of Billy’s science books that canola oil will get gum out of anyone’s hair, so she will trek all the way down the street to Foodarama to buy some. Though she doesn’t want her friends to get into trouble, they head out on the adventure with her.', 'Johnny catches up with Jen, who feels left out (she was late to Britt’s house because she was brushing her hair).\xa0 When Johnny admits no one brought any money with them, Jen comes up with a brilliant plan: She steals her charity box. After all, she saved her extra change for people in need, and Jen NEEDS to be with her best friend – especially since Hannah has been with Britt all this time. Jen joins the gang and gives the box to Britt.\xa0 She asks Britt if she’s now her number one bestest best friend instead of Hannah, but before Britt can answer, she discovers the box won’t open. Her friends try to convince Britt that it’s time to go home, but she gets in touch with her inner StinkyKid and persuades them to try to open the box by any means necessary. Hannah and Jen realize they have one thing in common: they’re worried about Britt’s poor behavior.\xa0 Fighting each other won’t help Britt, who has climbed all the way to the top of a slide and hurled the box to the ground.\xa0 Good news: they have the money. Bad news: the ice cream truck arrives. All of Britt’s friends want to get a cone, using their newly rescued money. Britt refuses to give over the money and accidentally knocks Jen to the ground.\xa0 She gives back the “stupid” box, shocking everyone that she used the “S” word.\xa0 Everyone wants to go home, so Britt makes the most rash move ever: She cuts the gum out of her hair!\xa0 Worse, she says they don’t need her parents to drive. They walked this far; they can walk to Captain Happy’s.', 'That’s the last straw.\xa0 Her friends decide to go home, because it’s the right thing to do – which Max refers to as being a “Leader of Good.” Britt, alone, lashes out that she can do this alone, but then weighs the good vs. bad of her situation. She comes to a heartfelt conclusion: Today, for the first time ever, she relied on her friends. They would want her to do what’s right.\xa0 She’ll go home, too. Too late: her mom finds her and grounds her.\xa0 That’s very long time out. After five days alone in her room, Britt resolves to stay in time out forever. She fees bad that she almost stole money from the charity box – money that was supposed to go to people who don’t have anything.\xa0 How can she ever make it up to them? She scours her room to find items to donate to charity. Her parents admire her ingenuity, and encourage her to ask her friends to help.\xa0 Britt’s afraid they might not want to play with her, but her mom says she’ll never know if she doesn’t leave her room. Britt leaves her room and finds her friends playing together – Jen and Hannah are even getting along.\xa0 She apologizes to everyone. They forgive her: it was a whole five days ago.\xa0 Even better, Jen and Hannah tell her that they’ll both be Britt’s best friends.\xa0 Britt confesses she’s can’t – and most likely won’t – be all good all the time, but vows she will always try to find a way to make up for whatever she did.\xa0 She then leads everyone to the charity place – which happens to be right next to Captain Happy’s!\xa0 After all, she’s the gum that keeps everyone sticking together.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

This was, of course, long before it was a park, when it was still wilderness and garbage. The family flourished for many generations, and eventually, a huge house was built where a great Spanish oak, the Addams Family Tree, had been planted to protect the ancestral graves from such annoyances as sunlight and tourists. As the curtain rises, the last dead leaf of autumn falls from the Family Tree, and all is right with the morbid, macabre world of Gomez, Morticia, Fester, Grandma, Wednesday, Pugsley and Lurch. They’ve gathered – where else? – in the family graveyard, to celebrate life and death in a yearly ritual to connect with their past and ensure their future. They seem at peace, not just with each other and their inimitable, unchanging Addams-ness, but with their dead ancestors, too – who emerge from their graves on this night each year to join in this celebration of continuity. But, at the end of the ritual, Fester blocks the ancestors’ return to their graves. Those unchanging Addams family values are about to be tested. Fester enlists their help to set things right, just in case a new family secret goes terribly wrong. What’s the secret? Wednesday Addams, that irresistible bundle of malice, has grown up and found love. So what’s the problem? The young man, Lucas Beineke, is from Ohio, and his parents are coming to dinner to meet the family. Two different worlds are about to collide. Will love triumph, or will everyone go home vaguely depressed?', 'Gomez and Morticia are understandably leery. Wednesday is their baby, even if she is eighteen. Their doubts bloom into actual terror when they eavesdrop on Wednesday, who, in the midst of her afternoon play-date with Pugsley, refuses to torture her brother and involuntarily bursts into song – extolling all things bright and beautiful as love pulls her in an entirely new, and cheerful, direction. Like any parents faced with a child in terrible trouble, Gomez and Morticia wonder, “Where did we go wrong?” Wednesday begs her parents not to cancel the dinner, and exhorts the entire family to act as ‘normal’ as possible when Lucas and his parents arrive. She loves her family just the way they are, but they clearly fall outside the realm of what the Middle-American Beinekes are used to, and Wednesday’s afraid that, if his parents don’t approve of her, they’ll take Lucas back to Ohio, and she’ll never see him again. Like any unconditionally loving family, the Addams’ promise to do their best to oblige, while, lost somewhere in Central Park, young Lucas asks his parents to resist any judgments and all catastrophic conflicts, so both families can enjoy one normal night. In yet another part of the house, Pugsley, having witnessed Wednesday and Lucas making out, worries that he’s lost his best friend to her new, disgustingly sunny disposition. Plotting to break up the happy couple, Pugsley steals a volatile potion from Grandma’s private stache – Acrimonium – one swig of which is guaranteed to bring out the dark side in anyone who drinks it.', 'After what is likely a less-than-normal meal, Wednesday quiets the table for Lucas’ surprise announcement. But Gomez reminds Wednesday that, before anything else happens, it’s time for the traditional Addams family game, “Full Disclosure” – during which everyone takes a sip from a sacred chalice and reveals something they’ve never told anyone. Gomez uses his Disclosure to try, again in vain, to calm Morticia. Fester announces that he’s in the throes of a most unlikely love – with the moon. When it’s Wednesday’s turn, Pugsley seizes his chance! He secretly pours the Acrimonium potion in the chalice and passes it to his sister. But his plan to awaken the dark side in Wednesday goes horribly wrong when Alice, coughing, intercepts the chalice and downs the potion instead. A whole new Alice, very dark and uninhibited, is born. The powerful poison prompts her to reveal the long-buried problems with her marriage, humiliating Mal, who, fed up with all the weird and creepy events of the evening, makes to leave, with Alice and Lucas in tow. Wednesday blurts out the news: “Lucas and I are getting married!” Chaos engulfs both families like a tidal wave, and Fester, ever-helpful, urges the Family Ancestors to work some magic – whipping up a sudden, terrible storm and trapping the Beinekes with the Addams family for the night. While the storm rages, Wednesday packs a bag, but Lucas has no appetite for running away and getting married without his parents’ blessing. Wednesday, furious at everything it means to be normal, and furious at herself for trying so hard to become somebody his parents would accept, leaves alone.', 'One more of Gomez’ foot-in-mouth episodes prompts Morticia to throw him out of her boudoir. Her world is changing and she’s not ready, and her only comfort is knowing that death is waiting for her, just around the corner. But it is very cold comfort indeed. In the guest room, Alice, under the influence of the darkness potion, can no longer rhyme. Neither can she tolerate her husband’s cynical attacks on Lucas and love. She packs him off with a pillow and blanket to sleep somewhere else, as the storm inside her heart, and outside in the park, rumbles to a conclusion. Once the rains have stopped, Fester heads outside for a couple of hours of moon-bathing, realizing – after observing the three couples fighting – the sheer luck of being in a long-distance relationship, with the distant silver orb in the sky that smiles down on him from the heavens. Sitting under the family tree, contemplating the twists and turns of this most unusual night, Gomez stops Wednesday on her way out of the park. He realizes the thing he was most resistant to – his baby girl’s growing up – is inevitable, and proper. He sees that she’s a young woman in love. And that makes him happy. And a tiny bit sad. With her father’s blessing, Wednesday offers Lucas one test to prove that he’s The One. The test involves her skills with a crossbow, an apple, and Lucas standing with said apple on his head in front of the family tree. The boy is afraid of death, \xa0but even more afraid of losing Wednesday. He chooses the possibility of death over the certainty of loss – and wins.', 'Far below, in the grotto, Gomez and Mal, two displaced husbands, realize they have more in common than they would have dared imagine only a few hours earlier. While Mal is with Gomez, Lurch ushers Alice down to the grotto. She’s a woman on a mission;\xa0she’s going to lay down the law; changes must be made if the marriage is to\xa0survive. Morticia packs a bag and is ready to leave. But the ancestors’ spirits have led Gomez to find her. The other warring couples, Wednesday and Lucas, Alice and Mal, have\xa0made their peace. Now Gomez woos his wife, as he first did one night many years\xa0before, with the promise to “laugh and cry and dance until the very gods weep\xa0with envy.” The mournful strains of a bandoneon waft up on the breeze, entwining\xa0with the tempting wail of a violin – and a tango begins – the Tango de Amor, the\xa0quintessence of Eros, the dance that makes men weep and women cry out in the\xa0night. The irresistible expression of love between husband and wife. And Morticia\xa0cannot resist. With all three couples reunited, Fester is emboldened to make his move, and\xa0launches himself to the moon. Landing safely, his face appears – the man in the\xa0moon – and, love having emphatically triumphed in heaven and on earth, the gate\xa0to the family crypt swings open, allowing the spirits of the ancestors to rest for\xa0another year. It’s been a night of darkness. Everything’s changed. And the new, extended family\xa0understands: The unknown may be frightening, the darkness overwhelming,but if we don’t run from it, we may see our mysterious, miraculous lives finally\xa0illuminated. If we move toward the darkness, we might find love and acceptance. For when it is dark enough, we can see the stars. -Rick Elice Bookwriter for The Addams Family']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

Somewhere in the midwest in the 1950’s, Chad, a hip-swiveling, guitar-playing roustabout is being released from jail (“Jailhouse Rock”). The warden doesn’t appreciate a guy like Chad ridin’ into town, playin’ his music and excitin’ the locals. Chad rides off on his motorbike. In a nearby dreary little town, Natalie, a young mechanic, is dreaming of love and adventure. She yearns for one true love to take her away, but she doesn’t realize that her best friend Dennis has a secret crush on her. Sitting in Sylvia’s, the local cafe, the whole town sings the blues (“Heartbreak Hotel”). Then the roar of a motorbike: it is Chad, riding into town. Chad is in need of a mechanic and he’s introduced to Natalie, who is instantly smitten and promises to fix his bike. Chad asks about any excitement in town, but he’s told that excitement is outlawed under the Mayor’s strict rules: no loud music, no indecent behavior. Chad, incensed, promises to breathe some life into this sad, little town and he touches a broken-down jukebox, and it immediately comes to life (“C’mon Everybody”). As Chad and Natalie go off to fix his bike, Mayor Matilda enters with Earl, the sheriff, and her son, Dean. Matilda scolds the citizens for dancing and singing, and then goes off to find the root of this newfound evil. As soon as she exits, Dean meets Lorraine, Sylvia’s pretty younger sister, and the two share a nervous and flirtatious smile. Meanwhile, Natalie is working on Chad’s motorbike. She tells him of her dreams of the open road, and he tells her that she must follow her heart (“Follow That \xa0Dream”). After Chad exits, Natalie, in an attempt to look more girly, puts on the only dress she owns—a tattered old one she uses to clean car engines. Dennis runs into Natalie and he is about to tell her how he feels for her, when Chad enters and interrupts. Ignoring Natalie, Chad asks Dennis to become his sidekick and the overjoyed Dennis accepts. Suddenly, the beautiful and glamorous Sandra, the new girl in town, appears, and Chad is struck down with a case of love! Chad tries to smooth-talk her, but she resists (“Teddy Bear/Hound Dog”).', 'Later that day, at Sylvia’s Honky-Tonk Cafe, Jim and Sylvia speak about the strange behavior that seems to have befallen the town since Chad’s arrival. Natalie enters in her greasy dress, and Lorraine has her change into one of her dresses—it is clean and cute and Natalie looks lovely. She rushes off in pursuit of Chad. Dean (the Mayor’s son) meets Matilda at the bus stop, after a brief meeting earlier, and she tells him that she’s sending him back to military school on the next bus. Lorraine enters, and Dean tells her the terrible news—they’re about to be separated. Hopelessly in love, Dean and Lorraine decide to run off together (“It’s Now Or Never”). Chad follows Sandra, but she will have nothing to do with him. Dennis meets Natalie on the street and shows off his new hunting cap, which makes him feel like “one of the guys.” Natalie has a sudden inspiration and she grabs Dennis’ hunting cap. Alone in the garage, she dresses as a leather-jacketed male roustabout. As Chad bemoans Sandra’s lack of attraction to him, Dennis comes up with an idea. He volunteers to take her a Shakespearean sonnet. Desperate, Chad agrees. But before Dennis leaves, a leather-jacketed roustabout rides into town (“Blue Suede Shoes”). It is Natalie, dressed as a fellah named Ed. Chad is excited by Ed’s coolness and manliness and he asks Ed to be his new sidekick. Heartbroken, Dennis exits. Chad instructs Ed that his first job as his new sidekick is to give the sonnet to Miss. Sandra. Ed arrives at the museum and gives Sandra the sonnet. Sandra is so moved by the sonnet that she finds herself drawn to this strange-looking young man.', 'As the sun goes down, Mayor Matilda is cracking down on the perceived immoral behavior that running rampant through the town. She comes upon a boy and girl holding hands, and she’s stunned to see that it’s her precious Dean with Lorraine. Dean, for the first time, disobeys his mother and shows her that he can now dance. He and Lorraine run off into the night. Matilda promises to throw Chad out of town for what he has done, and she and Sheriff Earl drive after Dean. Ed tells Chad that in order to avoid being kicked out of town, he should hide in the abandoned fairgrounds just outside of town. Chad runs off, and Ed runs off after him. Soon, everyone in town finds themselves escaping to the fairgrounds, searching for love.\xa0Dennis comes upon Natalie, who’s still dressed as Ed, and Dennis reveals that he’s upset about the way Chad treats her (“It Hurts Me”). Natalie insists that Chad is the only guy for her. In an attempt to win Chad, Natalie gets an idea—she convinces Chad to teach her (i.e. Ed) how to ask a girl out, but in the process, they experience a funny and uncomfortable moment. Sandra enters, looking for Ed. Left alone, Chad is about to hit Ed, but he realizes that he can’t. Ed gives Chad some “alone time”, and Chad realizes that he has feelings for his new sidekick.', 'In another part of the fairgrounds, Mayor Matilda enters, followed, as always, by the silent Sheriff Earl, and she vows to bring the roustabout down (“Devil In Disguise”). In another part of the grounds, Dean and Lorraine plan to catch the morning train out of town, but Chad convinces them and all the townsfolk to stay and fight for their love. In the center of the fairgrounds, Matilda gathers the townspeople together to form a pious posse to both find her son and arrest Chad. But Chad enters, as does Dean and Lorraine—and the final confrontation ends with rousing “All Shook Up,” and true love prevails!']","{'sets': ['TheatreWorld Backdrops'], 'costumes': [], 'props': ['Prop Rentals NY', 'Featuring\xa0Must Haves\xa0&\xa0Additional Choices', 'Phone: (516) 459-0106', 'John@proprentalsny.com']}"

Boston’s Colonial Theatre is host to the opening night performance of Robbin’ Hood!, “a new musical of the Old West”. The curtains rise on the show’s merciful finale. Act Two. Scene 23. As the valiant cast proclaims their undying affection for the Wide Open Spaces of Kansas, a sour note is sounded by the voice of faded film star Jessica Cranshaw, who can’t act, can’t sing, and can’t dance — not even a little. Jessica’s name may be above the title, but her performance has been beneath contempt, both on-stage and off. She takes her mandatory bow in front of the cowboy-costumed company, gathers up her obligatory bouquets from a pair of tuxedoed ushers, and collapses in a heap, easily the most graceful move she’s made all evening. The cast rushes to their fallen star behind the fallen curtain and bear the unbearable Jessica off to Boston Hospital.', 'A few hours later, on the now darkened Colonial stage, four tormented souls in evening dress search the night owl editions of the Boston morning papers for a single charitable review. The show’s composer, Aaron Fox and lyricist Georgia Hendricks — recently divorced but professionally reunited in an attempt to create musical magic where their marriage has otherwise gone flat — find nary a quote to pull. Equally empty-handed is the show’s lone financial backer Oscar Shapiro, garment district maven but theatre district novitiate. Slightly less daunted is Carmen Bernstein, co-producer (with her husband Sidney) of Robbin’ Hood! The four speculate about “What Kind of Man”, woman, or beast would ever choose to be a critic. They are joined by feverishly fey director, Christopher Belling, who announces he’s just given birth to a brainchild the producers must instantly adopt. To demonstrate his plan, he asks Georgia to sing Jessica Cranshaw’s first ballad in the show. It’s no secret to the company that Georgia has recently rekindled a past romance with leading man Bobby Pepper. Though her ex-husband may be accompanying her at the piano, Georgia is clearly thinking of Bobby as she sings “Thinking of Him”. Director Belling reveals his masterful plan: as long as Jessica Cranshaw is indisposed, her part should be filled by Georgia, a former stage performer who obviously knows the show inside and out because she is its co-creator. All approve, except ex-husband Aaron, who points out that the issue is academic if Jessica Cranshaw returns to work. But the fateful news arrives: “The Woman’s Dead”.', 'An impromptu funeral ceremony in Jessica’s honor is interrupted by the arrival of Homicide Lieutenant Frank Cioffi, who saw Robbin’ Hood! in previews and thinks that, with the exception of the late Miss Cranshaw, the cast are all spectacular performers in one heck of a show. The Lieutenant has done some amateur theatrical work himself, and he is as shocked as Carmen Bernstein to learn that the cast does not feel the show must go on. He and Carmen must remind the company that they are part of a special breed known as “Show People”. With their faith in themselves and Robbin’ Hood! renewed, the cast prepares to leave for the night when Cioffi explains that they can’t. Since an autopsy has revealed that Jessica Cranshaw swallowed poison pellets in the last minutes of the show, during which time she never left the stage, it’s clear she was murdered by a member of the company. Cioffi feels the surest way to solve the crime will be to keep the entire cast of suspicious characters sequestered in the theatre. Sidney Bernstein, the show’s senior producing partner (and Carmen’s philandering lesser half) arrives from New York — or at least that’s where he claims to have been at the time of the murder. Cioffi is left alone with local neophyte actress Niki Harris, who understudied Jessica Cranshaw but is now covering for Georgia. The police detective is clearly smitten with Niki’s winsome charm and confides in her about his investigation. They learn that they are both married … to their respective careers, which in Cioffi’s case has resulted in a life of lunch counter mornings and “Coffee Shop Nights”.', 'The next day, as Georgia struggles to regain her show biz sea legs, Carmen and Sidney Bernstein invite Boston Globe senior drama critic Daryl Grady to pay them a visit, much to his bewilderment, since his review of the show found precious little to praise. The producers ask Grady to re-review their musical with its new lead, but the best he can offer is to appraise the next evening’s re-opening. With Grady’s challenge accepted, Chris Belling prepares to restage a particularly troublesome number, entitled “In the Same Boat”. Cioffi is startled to hear himself suggest that the problem might lie in the song itself, and the director is surprised to hear himself agree. Composer Aaron Fox is urged to concoct a different number for the same slot in the show, minus the assistance of his ex-wife who, owing to her frantic rehearsal schedule, has now become his ex-writing partner as well. In private with Lieutenant Cioffi, the composer makes a most unexpected confession. (“I Miss the Music”) Any doubt that Georgia could hold the stage is happily dispelled by the dress rehearsal of the big saloon hall number “Thataway!” But as the Act One curtain descends, murder rises to the occasion, and a key member of the company is forced to face The Big Blackout.', 'The second act begins with the updated medical status of the most recent victim: “The Man is Dead”. Curtains rise upon a makeshift dormitory on the Colonial’s stage, as things go bump in the night and the company, in varying stages of dress and undress, point fingers of suspicion at each other, puzzling over whether She or “He Did It”. Cioffi arrives with a grim report from the coroner and even graver concerns about the show’s rapidly-approaching deadline. Aaron previews his best effort at “In the Same Boat #2” but the zealous Cioffi sends it back to the drawing board once again, while urging that star Bobby Pepper be added to the Fort Henderson square dance. This prompts Bambi, an aspiring chorine and also Carmen’s daughter, to plead for a pas de deux (“for two”) for herself and Bobby, as a spotlight moment in the number. Carmen reluctantly gives Bambi her chance, although she reminds her that a hard-nosed producer watches the box office, not the stage, and in commercial theatre, the bottom line is: “It’s a Business”. Much to Carmen’s surprise, Bambi shines in the rehearsal of the restaged Kansasland. But even as Bambi gets her big shot, Bobby Pepper gets his, from a gun offstage. Or was someone else the target? Cioffi’s craft as a detective takes center stage as he traces the bullet’s torturous path. He is also able to solve the mystery of why Aaron Fox and Georgia Hendricks were so anxious to work on Robbin’ Hood! as the former husband and wife team discover ample reason to renew their vows. (“Thinking of Him/I Miss the Music Reprise”).', 'With the spotlight suddenly on romance, Cioffi’s magnifying glass focuses on the ingénue who’s too-good-to-be-true. In his wildest dreams, instead of tracking footprints, he’d be trading steps with Niki up a theatrical stairway, making moves that even Fred and Ginger would find “A Tough Act to Follow”. But in the realm of homicide, the blink of an eye can turn daydream into nightmare, as Cioffi realizes that Niki is carrying a secret, one she has shared with stage manager Johnny Harmon. Johnny’s lips remain sealed — and the killer hopes to keep them that way forever. Cioffi’s investigation takes him high above the stage and, hearing the chorus below as they rehearse “In the Same Boat #3”, he hits upon a solution to some (if not all) the production’s problems, in a melodic amalgam that finally sees “In the Same Boat Completed”. With that immense puzzle solved to the company’s satisfaction, Cioffi has merely to piece together the clues he’s gathered, correctly unmask the killer, save the life of the murderer’s next intended victim, render the fiend harmless, make sense of a troubling but telltale observation, and find a new finale for the show. In doing so, Carmen Bernstein gives Cioffi the highest praise he could ever hope to receive: he is truly one of those “Show People” who understands why the show must go on. The revamped “Wide Open Spaces Finale” may be “A Tough Act to Follow (reprise)”, but for Lieutenant Frank Cioffi, the curtain is just about to rise on the greatest joy of his life.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

After a rather silly bit of miscommunication leads us briefly to Finland, our king and his ever faithful squire Patsy begin to search for knights to accompany him on his Quest. He finds his first in the unlikely guise of Dennis, a hideous local mud farmer. After convincing the locals that he is the king by conjuring the Lady of Lake to prove it, Dennis is transformed into Sir Galahad. The rest of the knights are found far and wide and The Lady of the Lake and her Laker Girls, send our stalwart band on their way. They meet up with an unforgettable slew of outrageously kooky characters and musical hilarity ensues as Arthur and the Knights make their journey.']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"

The warden doesn’t appreciate a guy like Chad ridin’ into town and playin’ his music. Chad rides off.', 'In a nearby dreary little town, Natalie, a young mechanic, is dreaming of love and adventure. She yearns for one true love to take her away, but she doesn’t realize that her best friend Dennis has a secret crush on her. Suddenly, Chad rides into town (“Roustabout”). Chad is in need of a mechanic and he’s introduced to Natalie, who is instantly smitten and promises to fix his bike. Chad asks about any excitement in town, but he’s told that excitement is outlawed under the Mayor’s strict rules: no loud music, no indecent behavior. Chad, incensed, promises to breathe some life into this sad, little town and he touches a broken-down jukebox, and it immediately comes to life (“C’mon Everybody”).', 'As Chad and Natalie go off to fix his bike, Mayor Matilda enters with Earl, the sheriff, and her son, Dean. Matilda scolds the citizens for dancing and singing, and then goes off to find the root of this newfound evil. As soon as she exits, Dean meets Lorraine, Sylvia’s pretty daughter, and the two share a nervous and flirtatious smile. Meanwhile, Natalie is working on Chad’s motorcycle. She tells him of her dreams of the open road, and he tells her that she must follow her heart. After Chad exits, Natalie, in an attempt to look more girly, puts on the only dress she owns—a tattered old one she uses to clean car engines. Dennis runs into Natalie and he is about to tell her how he feels for her, when Chad enters and interrupts. Ignoring Natalie, Chad asks Dennis to become his sidekick and the overjoyed Dennis accepts. Suddenly, the beautiful and glamorous Sandra appears, and Chad is struck down with a case of hardcore love. Sandra is the owner of the local museum, and she bemoans the lack of culture in this depressing little town. Chad tries to smooth-talk her, but she resists (“Teddy Bear/Hound Dog”).', 'Dean meets Matilda at the bus stop, and she tells him that she’s sending him back to military school on the next bus. Lorraine enters, and Dean tells her the terrible news—they’re about to be separated. Hopelessly in love, Dean and Lorraine decide to run off together (“It’s Now Or Never”).', 'Dennis shows Natalie his new hunting cap, which makes him feel like “one of the guys.” Natalie has a sudden inspiration and she grabs Dennis’ hunting cap. Alone in the garage, she dresses like a leather-jacketed male roustabout (“Love Me Tender”). As Chad bemoans Sandra’s lack of attraction to him, Dennis comes up with an idea. He volunteers to take her a Shakespearean sonnet. Desperate, Chad agrees. But before Dennis leaves, a leather-jacked roustabout rides into town (“Blue Suede Shoes”). It is Natalie, dressed as a fella named Ed. Chad is impressed and asks Ed to be his new sidekick. Heartbroken, Dennis exits. Chad instructs Ed that his first job as his new sidekick is to give the sonnet to Miss Sandra. Ed grabs the sonnet and rushes off.', 'Ed arrives at the museum and gives Sandra the sonnet. Sandra is so moved by the sonnet that she finds herself drawn to this strange-looking young man.', 'As the sun goes down, Mayor Matilda is cracking down on the perceived immoral behavior that is now running rampant through the town. Matilda promises to throw Chad in jail for what he has done, and she and Sheriff Earl drive after Dean. Soon, everyone in town finds themselves searching for someone to love (“Can’t Help Falling In Love”).', 'The citizens of the town are restless (“All Shook Up”). Dennis comes upon Natalie, who’s still dressed as Ed, and Dennis reveals that he’s upset about the way Chad treats her. Natalie insists that Chad is the only guy for her. In an attempt to win Chad, Natalie gets an idea—she convinces Chad to teach her (i.e. Ed) how to seduce a woman. Matilda gathers the townspeople together to form a pious posse to both find her son and arrest Chad.

Boarding the ship, the Captain introduces the boy to his pirate crew who share with him the ins and outs of a pirate’s life at sea. Jeremy is instructed on how to talk like a pirate and schooled in pirate manners and etiquette (or the lack thereof). In turn, Jeremy shares with them what a typical kid’s day is like and the wondrous game of soccer! The pirate world proves to have many surprises for Jeremy Jacob, not the least of which is when the fearsome pirate Sharktooth admits to him that he is really just a sensitive guy! When a storm arises, the skills of the crew are called upon to steer the ship to safety and Jeremy Jacob begins to wonder if the pirate life is really for him. But all is well and they arrive back at the beach in time for soccer practice – but not before they survey the area, following the map that Jeremy has drawn for them, leading them to the perfect spot to bury the treasure – his own backyard! They reminisce that it’s always good to go home and Jeremy realizes that the simple things in life, like a kiss and a warm tucking in at night, are among those that are most important. Parting is bittersweet, but before leaving,\xa0 the pirates assure Jeremy that they will be back if he ever needs them. He only has to fly the Jolly Roger, or he can simply find them at pirates-dot-aarrgh!

They are jumping rope, throwing spitballs and paper airplanes, and sleeping. The school janitors (Pop, Murray, Penny, Johnny, and Bud) explain that the students of Room 207 are notoriously awful. Miss Nelson, the teacher, enters and tries to get her students to focus. Instead of calmly listening to the story of Pinocchio, they are disruptive, rude, and completely disrespectful to their teacher.

Swamp begins the lesson, and the children are suddenly attentive and responsive.', 'Time passes and there is no sign of Miss Nelson. The homework assignments pile up. The students go in search of their teacher but to no avail. They speculate about what may have happened to Miss Nelson and head to the Police Station to get some official assistance in their search.', 'At the Police Station, Detectives McSmogg and Mc Smoog are, unfortunately, very little help and the students start to lose confidence. They meet at the local Ice Cream Shoppe and write a letter to Miss Nelson, begging her to return and promising to be better behaved (“Miss Nelson Is Missing”).', 'At school the next day, the students have proven they have changed. They are helping the janitors clean and comparing notes on their homework assignments, when in walks Miss Nelson! She is now able to successfully continue with the story of Pinocchio, and the students realize they now have the same qualities that turned Pinocchio into a real boy: obedience, unselfishness, and respect.', 'The janitors explain that Detectives McSmogg and McSmoog are now working on a new case: the missing Viola Swamp, and Miss Nelson reveals that Miss Viola Swamp was really Miss Nelson in disguise (“Finale”)!']","{'sets': [], 'costumes': [], 'props': []}"
